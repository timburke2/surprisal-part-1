Line 2 is pretty self-explanatory, but I think that line 3 is the hardest.  It refers to the fact that clay is 'baked' in a kiln, but also to the 'glaze' that often covers ceramics.  It perhaps is a little known fact, but clay with a fine consistency is actually very dangerous to ingest.  Finally, line 4 refers to ancient pottery showing archaeologists the past, but clay still has many uses in building and pottery today.</p></blockquote><hr><p><sup><em>My first puzzle!

That means any two pieces with a tap and a blank fit together.</p><p>I still want to have my puzzles a unique correct solution. So in spite of the individual pieces fitting together in lots of ways there should be only one way to arrange all pieces into a rectangle.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> What is the biggest puzzle in terms of number of pieces I can make?</p><p>Here are two examples of puzzles I could make with the machine. Any individual piece can be described by listing the four sides in clockwise order. Each can be a (s)ide, a (t)ap or a (b)lank.</p><p>Puzzle A consists of the four pieces (s,s,t,t), (s,s,t,b), (s,s,b,t) and (s,s,b,b). This can be assembled as a 2 by 2 puzzle in a unique way (up to rotation). This is a good puzzle.</p><p>Puzzle B consists of the four pieces (s,s,t,t), (s,s,t,b), (s,s,t,b) and (s,s,b,b). This can be assembled as a 2 by 2 puzzle in two distinct ways. So there is no unique solution and I don't want that.</p><p>PS: This can be solved with pen and paper, no computer required. If someone wants to make helpful pictures feel free to edit.</p><p><strong>Edit</strong> in response to comments: If a piece can be rotated in place the picture would still be off so that would count as distinct ways to assemble.

Congratulations.</strong></p>    <p><strong>There is a small challenge though Dr. Jones. The treasure is in the back of the building and to get there you MUST go through one of the two  rooms in front of you. Once you are in a room the door will close  behind you and you must go to the other side of the room and open the  back door to get to the space with the treasure. Simple, right?</strong></p>    <p><strong>Except, Dr. Jones, ONE of the two rooms is plumbed nicely for a delightful concentrated acid shower. Walls and ceiling have small  holes which will drench you with sulfuric acid as soon as you start  walking through the room. Nice eh?</strong></p>    <p><strong>Now I am a decent person Dr. Jones. So I have made the other room safe. You can just walk across. However both rooms look exactly the same. Same walls, color, even the small holes. You are wondering which  is which, but I am sure with your talent you can figure that out. Oh, and if you have thoughts of just opening the door to take a look or smell, forget it. You can only open one door. As soon as you do it the other door gets locked. Also the showers are triggered by multiple sensors, not just weight. Good Luck Dr. Jones</strong></p></blockquote><p>Jones badly wanted the treasure. He had no protective equipment against the acid.

However, because the jewelry is so special there are some rules that he should follow when creating it.</p><p>He has 30 types of beads and unlimited count from each type. Every bead has different color but for simplicity lets name them (<span class=\"math-container\">$B_1$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\">$B_2$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\">$B_3$</span>, <span class=\"math-container\">$B_4$</span> ... <span class=\"math-container\">$B_{30}$</span> because this is not important). The important part is that every bead type costs different amount of gold coins</p><p><span class=\"math-container\">$$B_1\\text{ -> 1 gold coin}$$</span></p><p><span class=\"math-container\">$$B_2\\text{ -> 2 gold coins}$$</span></p><p><span class=\"math-container\">$$B_3\\text{ -> 3 gold coins}$$</span></p><p><span class=\"math-container\">$$\\dots$$</span></p><p><span class=\"math-container\">$$B_{30}\\text{ -> 30 gold coins}$$</span></p><p>There are three special operations that he can use when creates the jewelry:</p><ol><li>He can buy beads, but every time when he buys a bead he should put it at the end of the jewelry.</li></ol><p>For example:</p><ul><li><p>When he starts the jewelry no bead is added, so he can buy for example <span class=\"math-container\">$B_4$</span> for <span class=\"math-container\">$4$</span> gold coins and put it on the first place</p></li><li><p>After that he can buy another bead, for example <span class=\"math-container\">$B_6$</span> for <span class=\"math-container\">$6$</span> gold coins and he should put it at the end.</p><p>Now he has jewelry from <span class=\"math-container\">$B_4$</span> - <span class=\"math-container\">$B_6$</span></p></li><li><p>After that he can buy another bead, for example <span class=\"math-container\">$B_{11}$</span> for <span class=\"math-container\">$11$</span> gold coins and he should put it at the end.</p><p>Now he has jewelry from <span class=\"math-container\">$B_4$</span> - <span class=\"math-container\">$B_6$</span> - <span class=\"math-container\">$B_{11}$</span></p></li></ul><p>The total amount of gold coins that he used for creation of this jewelry is <span class=\"math-container\">$21$</span></p><ol start=\"2\"><li>He is so good that if he has jewelry from some beads he can cast a magic and he can increment all the beads with one. However, this magic costs <span class=\"math-container\">$2$</span> gold coins.</li></ol><p>For example:</p><ul><li><p>If we continue with the jewelry from the previous point <span class=\"math-container\">$B_4$</span> - <span class=\"math-container\">$B_6$</span> - <span class=\"math-container\">$B_{11}$</span>, he can cast this magic and the result will be a new jewelry <span class=\"math-container\">$B_5$</span> - <span class=\"math-container\">$B_7$</span> - <span class=\"math-container\">$B_{12}$</span>. This operation will cost for him <span class=\"math-container\">$2$</span> gold coins.</p></li><li><p>If he continue incrementing one more time, the jewelry will become: <span class=\"math-container\">$B_6$</span> - <span class=\"math-container\">$B_8$</span> - <span class=\"math-container\">$B_{13}$</span>. This will cost him <span class=\"math-container\">$2$</span> gold coins.</p></li></ul><p>From these two steps he spend <span class=\"math-container\">$4$</span> more gold coins and the total amount of the jewelry at the moment is <span class=\"math-container\">$25$</span></p><ol start=\"3\"><li>The third and the last operation that he can use is to switch position of two adjacent beads.

One of them should be switched with all the others in order to get to the other.</p><p>Computers are allowed. However, I am not sure how to write a program to solve the problem.</p><p>The general approach of solving that I took is:</p><p>Edit 1: I removed my approach just not to give a possibly wrong direction for solving. The approach that I took is similar to the first answer of the question from @AxiomaticSystem</p><p>Edit 2: I replace the word bracelet with jewelry to remove the confusion that the beginning and the end of the jewelry are connected and we can switch their positions.

        "Body": "<h2>The riddle</h2><p>Randall Munroe (of <a href=\"https://xkcd.com\">xkcd</a> fame) has, a bit hidden on his site, <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/blue_eyes.html\">a logic puzzle</a>:</p><blockquote>  <p>A group of people with assorted eye colors live on an island. They are  all perfect logicians -- if a conclusion can be logically deduced,  they will do it instantly. No one knows the color of their eyes. Every  night at midnight, a ferry stops at the island. Any islanders who have  figured out the color of their own eyes then leave the island, and the  rest stay. Everyone can see everyone else at all times and keeps a  count of the number of people they see with each eye color (excluding  themselves), but they cannot otherwise communicate. Everyone on the  island knows all the rules in this paragraph.</p>    <p>On this island there are 100 blue-eyed people, 100 brown-eyed people,  and the Guru (she happens to have green eyes). So any given blue-eyed  person can see 100 people with brown eyes and 99 people with blue eyes  (and one with green), but that does not tell him his own eye color; as  far as he knows the totals could be 101 brown and 99 blue. Or 100  brown, 99 blue, and he could have red eyes.</p>    <p>The Guru is allowed to speak once (let's say at noon), on one day in  all their endless years on the island. Standing before the islanders,  she says the following:</p>    <p>\"I can see someone who has blue eyes.\"</p>    <p>Who leaves the island, and on what night?</p>    <p>There are no mirrors or reflecting surfaces, nothing dumb. It is not a  trick question, and the answer is logical. It doesn't depend on tricky  wording or anyone lying or guessing, and it doesn't involve people  doing something silly like creating a sign language or doing genetics.  The Guru is not making eye contact with anyone in particular; she's  simply saying \"I count at least one blue-eyed person on this island  who isn't me.\"</p>    <p>And lastly, the answer is not \"no one leaves.\"</p></blockquote><p>He admits the puzzle isn't his:</p><blockquote>  <p>I didn't come up with the idea of this puzzle, but I've written and rewritten it over the the years to try to make a definitive version. The guy who told it to me originally was some dude on the street in Boston named Joel.</p></blockquote><h2>The answer</h2><p>He gives <a href=\"https://xkcd.com/solution.html\">his solution</a>:</p><blockquote>  <p>The answer is that on the 100th day, all 100 blue-eyed people will leave. It's pretty convoluted logic and it took me a while to believe the solution, but here's a rough guide to how to get there. Note -- while the text of the puzzle is very carefully worded to be as clear and unambiguous as possible (thanks to countless discussions with confused readers), this solution is pretty thrown-together. It's correct, but the explanation/wording might not be the best. If you're really confused by something, let me know.</p>    <p>If you consider the case of just one blue-eyed person on the island, you can show that he obviously leaves the first night, because he knows he's the only one the Guru could be talking about. He looks around and sees no one else, and knows he should leave. So: [THEOREM 1] If there is one blue-eyed person, he leaves the first night.</p>    <p>If there are two blue-eyed people, they will each look at the other. They will each realize that \"if I don't have blue eyes [HYPOTHESIS 1], then that guy is the only blue-eyed person. And if he's the only person, by THEOREM 1 he will leave tonight.\" They each wait and see, and when neither of them leave the first night, each realizes \"My HYPOTHESIS 1 was incorrect. I must have blue eyes.\" And each leaves the second night.</p>    <p>So: [THEOREM 2]: If there are two blue-eyed people on the island, they will each leave the 2nd night.</p>    <p>If there are three blue-eyed people, each one will look at the other two and go through a process similar to the one above. Each considers the two possibilities -- \"I have blue eyes\" or \"I don't have blue eyes.\" He will know that if he doesn't have blue eyes, there are only two blue-eyed people on the island -- the two he sees. So he can wait two nights, and if no one leaves, he knows he must have blue eyes -- THEOREM 2 says that if he didn't, the other guys would have left. When he sees that they didn't, he knows his eyes are blue. All three of them are doing this same process, so they all figure it out on day 3 and leave.</p>    <p>This induction can continue all the way up to THEOREM 99, which each person on the island in the problem will of course know immediately. Then they'll each wait 99 days, see that the rest of the group hasn't gone anywhere, and on the 100th night, they all leave.</p>    <p>Before you email me to argue or question: This solution is correct. My explanation may not be the clearest, and it's very difficult to wrap your head around (at least, it was for me), but the facts of it are accurate. I've talked the problem over with many logic/math professors, worked through it with students, and analyzed from a number of different angles. The answer is correct and proven, even if my explanations aren't as clear as they could be.</p>    <p>User lolbifrons on reddit posted <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/khhpl/reddit_what_is_your_favorite_riddle/c2kdlr6\">an inductive proof</a>.</p>    <p>If you're satisfied with this answer, here are a couple questions that may force you to further explore the structure of the puzzle: </p>    <ol>  <li>What is the quantified piece of information that the Guru provides that each person did not already have? </li>  <li>Each person knows, from the beginning, that there are no less than 99 blue-eyed people on the island. How, then, is considering the 1 and 2-person cases relevant, if they can all rule them out immediately as possibilities? </li>  <li>Why do they have to wait 99 nights if, on the first 98 or so of these nights, they're simply verifying something that they already know? </li>  </ol>    <p>These are just to give you something to think about if you enjoyed the main solution. They have answers, but please don't email me asking for them. They're meant to prompt thought on the solution, and each can be answered by considering the solution from the right angle, in the right terms. There's a different way to think of the solution involving hypotheticals inside hypotheticals, and it is much more concrete, if a little harder to discuss. But in it lies the key to answering the four questions above.</p></blockquote><h2>The question</h2><p>Everybody on the island could have come to the conclusion that 'There is at least one person with blue eyes', simply by looking around, seeing 100 people with blue eyes, and realising that everybody can see at least one person with blue eyes.</p><p><strong>So why is it necessary for the Guru to say 'I see at least one person with blue eyes' to get the ball rolling?</strong></p>",

This would yield the answer of 1/3.</li><li>From all families with two children, one child is selected at random, and the sex of that child is specified. This would yield an answer of 1/2.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Many formulations have a less technical problem: when a parent says that they have \"two children and one of them is a boy\", it's nearly impossible to read that in English without thinking \"therefore the other one is a girl\".</p><p>Can you rephrase the paradox so that the proper randomizing procedure is specified and the Bayesian logic is the crux of the problem?</p>",

Being the genius he is, he learnt five languages on that mundane Sunday. And as he was practising his newly acquired linguistic skills, he heard a knock on the door. 221B came alive...</p><p>It was a woman, in her mid-fifties, dressed well enough to be in the upper middle class; hair was tied -- had taken her time to decide to come to meet him -- but looked in distress as if she had seen a murder. Deductions aside, Sherlock asked her to sit and tell what had happened. She started telling her story, controlling her tears.</p><blockquote><p>\"My husband was in military.\"</p><p>\"Sorry to interrupt you, but 'was'?\" said Holmes.</p><p>\"Yes, he died last night,\" she replied, barely controlling her tears.</p><p>\"Oh, I am sorry. Please continue...\" Holmes said whilst sitting on a chair next to her.</p><p>\"He was a very good man, a great husband. We had a happy marriage, been married for almost thirty years. He had come home after retiring about a week ago. He was happy to have served the nation with all his intelligence and strength. After taking a rest the whole day, we had a good dinner last night at the best restaurant in the city. He started watching a movie, I can't remember the name, but it was about Indo-Pak war. He was all nostalgic about his glorious epoch in army, also boasted about the good direction and appreciated the dialogues. I can't understand Hindi, but I agreed with whatever he said. After the movie ended, we went to sleep. He was having a dream about his life in Africa. After that, I too dozed off. The first thing I did after waking up in the morning was kiss him on his forehead. To my surprise, his skin was cold. I tried to wake him up, but he didn't respond. I tried to feel his heartbeat, he had none. He probably had a heart attack. I immediately called a doctor, who came after an hour. After the checkup, the feel of his face told a horror story. My husband was dead. The doctor said it was indeed a cardiac arrest. I am not able to digest that the person who was so happy in the day, who had no medical history of any disease whatsoever, died of a heart attack. I have no hope left. I think someone murdered him. He had enemies who have access to military level tech. They must have killed him for something. Please help me.\"</p></blockquote><p>After hearing all this, Holmes, who was already suffering from linguistic information overflow couldn't speak. All his mastery over language came to a standstill. Coming back to his senses, he asked whether they had any other family members. She replied that all they had was a cook, who was like their son. He was with them for the last twenty years, helped in household work and cooked great food. It was not possible that someone had bribed him to murder her husband.</p><p>All this was too much information, even for someone like Sherlock Holmes to process.</p><p>He knows that there is an awesome puzzle solving community on StackExchange that can help him to solve this case which is a bit awkward for his tired brain to handle.</p><p>So, can you help him solve the case?</p>",

Consider a regular 5-gon $ABCDE$ in 3-dimensional space that is situated in the $xy$-plane so that its center lies in the origin. Consider a further point $F$ on the $z$-axis somewhere above the origin, and a point $G$ that results by reflecting $F$ across the origin. If one connects every corner of the 5-gon $ABCDE$ by two edges to $F$ and $G$, this will yield a polyhedron $P_{10}$ with 10 congruent triangular faces. My fair 10-sided dice is essentially $P_{10}$ with the sides labeled by the numbers 1,2,...,10. Throw it up into the air, look how it lands, and take the side on which it lands as your random number. (With a cube one always takes the top side, but $P_{10}$ has no top side). By the symmetry of $P_{10}$ it is obvious that all $10$ numbers are equally probable.</p><p>If I modify this construction and replace the regular 5-gon by a regular $n$-gon, I shall get a fair $2n$-sided dice with an even number of sides.</p><hr><p>My <strong>question</strong> is whether there also exist <strong>fair</strong> $(2n+1)$-sided dice with an odd number of sides.

It was sold for relatively low price because, quote, \"a previous owner has made pointless remarks inside and ruined the leather cover\". I didn't give much attention to the fact, but was really surprised when I saw the book.</p><p>First of all, on the back cover the words \"<strong>Why did the chicken cross the river?</strong>\" were cut (yes, this made me chuckle too). Second of all, inside the book there were occasional phrases written in red and blue ink. Weird... phrases. They appeared to be of a question-and-answers joke, or, how my younger friends tend to call them 'setup-punchline' jokes. I've made some research on the ink and the book -- it appears, both the book and the jokes date back to 1600-s, probably originating from some not-so-faithful priest practicing his humorous skills on the paper he could get. I was very intrigued.</p><p>After thorough look through the pages, I have found 22 questions and, unfortunately, only 12 answers.

        "Body": "<p>I found this puzzle <a href=\"http://www.folj.com/bb/viewtopic.php?t=12849\" rel=\"noreferrer\">online</a>:</p><blockquote><p>On the top floor of a castle lives a princess. The floor has 17 bedrooms arranged in a row. Each bedroom has doors connecting to the adjoining bedrooms as well as to the outside corridor. The princess sleeps in a different bedroom each night by opening the door to an adjoining bedroom and spending the night and the next day in that room.</p><p>One day a prince arrives at the castle and is desirous of marrying the princess. The guardian angel at the castle tells him of the princess' sleeping patterns and informs him that each morning he may knock on one of the outside doors. If the princess happens to be behind that door, she will open it and consent to marry him. The prince also has a return ticket to his kingdom in 30 days, so he can make at most 30 attempts. Can the prince win the hand of the princess, and if so, what is his strategy?</p></blockquote><p>An unstated assumption here is that the princess can move to <em>any</em> adjacent room (she's not restricted to moving in one direction). So a possible sequence could be 3, 2, 3, 4, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2...</p><p>Further down the thread at the link, this solution is given:</p><blockquote><p>The Prince should knock on the second door from one of the ends of the corridor (call it door #2), and knock on the next adjacent door each successive day until he reaches the second door from the opposite end of the corridor (door #16). The day after that, he should begin the same process in reverse order (meaning he will knock on the 16th door two days in a row). By the time he reaches his starting point (door #2 on the 30th day), he will have found the princess.</p><p>Number the doors 1 thru 17.<br />If the princess occupies an even numbered room on the day the prince first knocks on a door (#2), then she will either occupy the same room he knocks on or she will be an even number of rooms away. Since both move to an adjacent room each day, this will hold true so she will never be in a room adjacent to the one he knocks on, and thus never be in a position to move past him the next day. She will have nowhere else to go by the time he reaches the 16th door, and will have by then been located. If she, on the other hand, was in an odd numbered room when he began, then she will be in an even numbered room when the prince starts the process again on day 16 (when he knocks on door #16 the second time).</p></blockquote><p>I've been trying to follow the solution, but I don't quite get it. The main assumption the logic in the solution seems to hinge on is this: <strong>\"she will never be in a room adjacent to the one he knocks on, and thus never be in a position to move past him the next day.\"</strong> I can't figure out what evidence from the puzzle supports that assumption. If we begin knocking at door #2 and the princess is in room #3, our next move (following this solution) will be to knock on door #3. But at this point the princess could have moved to room #2, and we will keep moving to higher numbered rooms, and the princess could easily remain in the lower-numbered rooms.</p><p>So I'm having trouble understanding why this is the solution. Can someone explain it more clearly/in a different manner? Why will this process ensure the princess is found?</p>",

The keynote speaker, a distinguished Earthican mathematician, stood up, and began her address, stating various truths about the sums, products, differences, and quotients of pairs of real numbers. Unfortunately, as she continued, she realized that the crowd was bewildered - and that, every time she said \"zero\", the Neptunians would make a pitiful noise with their speech-glands, and every time she said \"one\", the Mercurians would make what is surely an obscene gesture with their noodly appendages.</p><p>She paused and thought, and it dawned on her:</p><ul><li><p>Though every member of the audience knew that her talk would concern only the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division over the real numbers, there was no common language</p></li><li><p>The words \"zero\" and \"one\" are words in other languages, but they roughly translate to grievous insults about the alien's version of a \"face\" or \"mother\".

For instance$$2+2=4$$$$4/2=2$$Is ambiguous because if the aliens believed \"/\" meant \"-\" (i.e. swapped the operations in all equations), they'd get the equally correct$$2+2=4$$$$4-2=2.$$Thus, from the first two equations, they would not be able to determine the meaning of \"/\", as it would be equally true if it referred to division or subtraction.</p><p>For instance, were only \"+\" and \"*\" to be used, and were $0$ and $1$ allowable words, the following three statements would be a solution:$$1*1=1$$$$0+0=0$$$$1+1=2$$As the aliens would, from the first two, be able to deduce that 1 was the identity element of * and 0 was the identity element of +. The only alternate translation of those two is$$0+0=0$$$$1*1=1$$however, under those rules, the last statement translations to$$0*0=c$$(where $c$ is whatever 2 translates to) - but this is false, since $0*0=0$, and the aliens can recognize that $c$ was not the same word as meant $0$.

Spy 1 has number <span class=\"math-container\">$N_1$</span> to tell Spy 2, and Spy 2 has number <span class=\"math-container\">$N_2$</span> to tell spy 1.<br /><br /> 1. The spies agree that each number <span class=\"math-container\">$N$</span> from <span class=\"math-container\">$1$</span> to <span class=\"math-container\">$42$</span> shall be represented by a combination of two numbers <span class=\"math-container\">$(m_1, m_2)$</span>, where <span class=\"math-container\">$1 \\le m_1 \\le 7$</span> and <span class=\"math-container\">$1 \\le m_2 \\le 6$</span>. Since there are exactly 42 possible combinations of <span class=\"math-container\">$(m_1, m_2)$</span>, it is possible for them to make this mapping.<br /><br /> 2.

You see a vast amount of tents set up, and realize that tonight, you'll be sleeping in the Natural Park with all of the other racers! After a long time spent traveling, you could use a break. Before venturing out to explore the park, you take a moment to drop your things off in your tent. In your tent, you find a sleeping bag, a lantern, and another envelope.</p><p>Deciding it would be best to read the letter and get it out of the way now, you open the envelope and find the following enclosed:</p><blockquote>  <p>Dear <strong><em>[insert username here]</em></strong>,</p>    <p>Welcome to Vall de Sorteny Natural Park! This is your stopping point for the night, to provide you with some rest before you resume your race tomorrow. Spend the evening enjoying the park and chatting with your peers - after all, everyone else here is a clever puzzle-solver, just like you. </p>    <p>On the flip side of this note, you'll find a simple brainteaser. Don't stress too much over it, as it's just to help pass the time. The important thing for you to do right now is enjoy your stay, as this park cost a <em>fortune</em> to rent for the night!</p>    <p>Yours truly,</p>    <p>Bailey M<br>  Puzzlemaster for the Treasure Hunt 'Round the World</p>    <p><em>P.S. The answer to the brainteaser will once again be a question. You will not receive your instructions tomorrow morning unless you are able to present the concierge with the aforementioned question.

He has a bit of grievance over his head as so do the other chefs, since there was a chef named Samuel that has gone missing for about 2 days. As he was cleaning the kitchen, he noticed an oil fryer that seemed to be bubbling for the last couple days, a timeline strangely close to how long Samuel was gone. Using an aluminum ladle, Maxwell dug in to the fryer only to jump back in absolute terror as a burned head was surfaced.</p><p>Forensic experts clarified that it was Samuel's head.</p><p>The chefs were frightened that a killer was afoot in their troupe. The chefs were asked to talk about what they were doing on the night of the death. Due to the group chat they have with each other on their cell phones, the chefs agreed that this would be easy.</p><p>Nathaniel: I was asked to go clean up the restaurant floors outside the kitchen when I heard a horrifying scream come from the kitchen. When I ran inside, I saw Evan making the call on his phone to tell everyone that someone kidnapped Samuel.</p><p>Tina: I had the day off and was woken up from a light sleep when I got the call.</p><p>Evan: As Nathaniel said, I was calling everyone about the kidnapping. I have bad wounds on my back and neck that still hurt from trying to fight off the kidnapper. I couldn't very well see who it was though.</p><p>Valerie: I, like Tina, had the day off, though I didn't want to stay home due to how much I loved work. I was having fun on the Ferris wheel when I got the call.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is that the kidnapper introduced himself to Samuel as the brother of an anonymous chef he fell for, but his sexual preference was unknown by the other chefs. Still, the police managed to arrest the culprit chef. Can you tell whodunit? </p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> It seems like you all are overthinking it. Think about the fact that it was the whole park's closing time, as in, when the chefs of this amusement park were cleaning.

These chessboards give the detectives the opportunity to decipher where, how and when Nelson will perform again. (Note: you should know <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess\" rel=\"noreferrer\">how chess is played</a> and how chessboard squares are enumerated).</p><p>Detectives <strong>Brandon</strong> and <strong>Makeda</strong> are the two agents in charge of these murders. Brandon, who is the superior of Makeda, won’t forget his black hat under any circumstance. There are also 2 things worth noting:</p><ol><li><em>Both detectives are left-handed.</em></li><li><em>When investigating a corpse, they like keeping as close as possible to it.</em></li></ol><hr><p><strong>Scene 1 (26/Jan/2016)</strong></p><p>It is known this was the second victim of Nelson; the remains of the first victim were never found.</p><p>The lifeless body of a 19 year-old teenager was found hanging upside-down a tree. Right under the body, detectives found the first diagram and a very particular weapon next to it. Under the diagram there was a note:</p><blockquote>  <p>You first, Makeda. Do it the best you can. And remember: <em>I'm always one step ahead</em> of you both.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TE2fb.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/TE2fb.png\" alt=\"Scene-1\"></a></p><hr><p><strong>Scene 2 (27/Feb/2016)</strong></p><p>At the scene, the detectives found an old man’s body, with two shots to the head. Next to the body, there were three bullets; it seems that one of them was never used. The serial killer left this chessboard, with some <strong>g/unpowder</strong> spread all over the pieces. There was a note:</p><blockquote>  <p>I love how <em>weak</em> my victims are, detectives. That's the beauty behind murdering people.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z6l76.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Z6l76.png\" alt=\"Scene-2\"></a></p><hr><p><strong>Scene 3 (10/Apr/2016)</strong></p><p>Detectives were feeling really agitated. Three murders in less than 3 months. They needed to stop this massacre, so this last chessboard was crucial to find a pattern and predict the next place for a possible crime.</p><p>A beautiful, mid-aged woman had her hands and feet tied down, three shots to the chest. She was lying on the grass, and there was no evidence she had been abused. Again, the typical chessboard next to her, with a note: </p><blockquote>  <p>You move again, detectives. And know, by the way, I just <em>broke down your  car</em>. Mine is wrecked as well, but that won't stop me.</p>    <p>Know, by the way, that <em>while you are reading this note, I am killing  my 5th victim!</em> There I won't leave any chessboards whatsoever. Will  you stop me before I kill my 6th victim?</p></blockquote><h2><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rJrG6.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/rJrG6.png\" alt=\"Scene-3\"></a></h2><p>Scared of what they just read, they knew there was going to be a 5th victim. Having these diagrams and notes, detectives need to find out:</p><ol><li><strong>Where</strong> (square) will the detectives find the 5th poor soul?</li><li><strong>Where</strong> (square) will Nelson <em>try</em> to kill his 6th victim?</li><li><strong>When</strong> (day and month) does Nelson <em>intend</em> to kill the 6th victim?</li><li>Can you say anything about <strong>how</strong> (weapon/method) Nelson intends to murder his 5th victim?</li><li>Nelson said he wouldn't leave any chessboards in Scene 4, but if he did, <strong>what would that chessboard be?</strong></li></ol><p><em>(<strong>Note</strong>: the dates indicated for each scene, are the dates for which detectives Brandon and Makeda find a dead body on the scene of the crime. This concides with the date when the next victim is being murdered.)</em></p><hr><p><strong>Hint 1</strong></p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> First, try to determine what role each piece play (i.e. Brandon, Makeda, Nelson and the Victim). You will note there are two extra pieces. Read through all notes carefully, and in particular, the 3rd note will give you a clue of what those 2 excess pieces are.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Hint 2</strong></p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> The number of shots doesn't mean anything - it just adds value to the story. The date of crimes doesn't mean anything either, but they <em>do</em> follow a pattern you need to guess.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Hint 3</strong></p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> Detectives suspect that the weapons used to commit the crimes will help them identify <em>which chess piece</em> is playing the <em>role of the serial killer</em>. As some of you have noticed, I wrote <strong>g/unpowder</strong> instead of <strong>gunpowder</strong>, and this is not casual. By the way, detectives need to know the name of the weapon used in Scene 1. Can you help them?</p></blockquote>",

To make this doable, we allow <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_definition\">circular</a> self-referential statements, like the famous example, \"this statement is false\". Formally, a circular self-referential statement is an equation of the form $$s = f(x_1,\\dots,x_n,s)$$where $x_1,\\dots,x_n$ are grounded logical propositions (like \"I am a Knave\"),   $f$ is a Boolean function, and $s$ is a Boolean variable. We say that such a statement is True if setting $s=$ True makes the equation hold, and similarly say it is False if $s=$ False is a solution. This means some such statements are both True and False, while others are neither. For example, \"this statement is false\" would be the equation $s=\\neg s$, which has no solutions, so is neither True nor False. On the other hand, \"this statement is true\" would be $s=s$, which is both True and False.</p><p>We then allow knights to say any True statement, Knaves to say any False statement, while Normals can say a statement as long as it is True or False or both.</p>",

My program simply takes a line from the input, processes it, outputs the result, and then moves on to the next, like the eternal soul that moves from one body to another ...\"</p><p>The master shook his head.  \"If such be your code, Ananda, then it can only mean that you have scripted somewhere a seek command on one of your files.\"</p><p>\"My program does not seek, O wise one.  It is only I who seek an answer to this great mystery.\"</p><p>The master laughed.  \"Come now, Ananda.  It is no mean task to reverse the order of lines even intentionally, and you would have me believe that you have done so by accident?  Was it not just a few days ago that I explained to you: how the insertion of a line at the start of a document is merely an illusion perpetuated by text editors, while reality requires the entire file to be rewritten on disk?\"</p><p>\"Indeed, I do remember your teaching, master.  But if theory and practice be in contradiction with each other, then which should one regard as reality, and which as illusion, O learned one?\"</p><p>The master frowned.  \"I find your insistence both annoying and disturbing.  Come, show me this magical program of yours, that I may rid you of this delusion once and for all.\"</p><p>\"Gladly, master.  ... In preparation for your visit, I have already cleansed my directory of all save my program and the input file. ...

Here it is.\"</p><p>The master breathed deeply.  \"Let's see...  Your file is named <code>output.txt</code> ... <em>search</em> ... and this name appears only once here in this <code>open</code> command, whose result is assigned to this variable <code>ofp</code> ... <em>search</em> ... and this <code>ofp</code> is used only in this <code>puts</code> command ... that prints this variable ... which is the result of this string processing ... on this variable ... which is set by this <code>gets</code> command, reading from your input file handle ... inside this loop ... which ... ... ... does ... nothing else ... ... ... ?!\"</p><p>Ananda sat silent.

Pray tell me what two lines of code you did add.\"<br><br> The master smiled compassionately.  \"It is the self-analysis technique of the ancients, Ananda.  Both the lines are simple <code>puts</code> commands to the console.  One after the <code>gets $ifp sInput</code> saying <code>puts \"here 11111 reading ....... $sInput\"</code>, and one before the <code>puts $ofp $sOutput</code> saying <code>puts \"here 11111 writing ....... $sOutput\"</code>.  The output of these two lines shall transcend the structure and logic of your program, and tell us what really it is attempting to do.  Then either we shall know it to be reading backwards, or to be writing backwards, or perchance we shall find the numbering and sequence of reading and writing to be as it should not be, and thusly shall we realize where to look next.\"<br><br> Ananda watched in awe as the master ran the program, whose consciousness level had just been raised.<br><br> And lo!  There appeared on the screen 20 lines in all: 10 for reading and 10 for writing, the reading and writing being in exact alternation with each other, and both sets in precisely the same order as the input!  The only reversal to be seen was on the face of the master.<br><br> After a pause, the master smiled knowingly, as one smiles when one has truly known nothingness.  \"Such a perfect harmony between the reading and the writing,\" he murmured, \"And yet, somewhere there is a disturbance in the <em>yin</em> and <em>yang</em> of this program.  For though the writing on the console be in order, yet the contents of the output file are reversed.\"<br><br> \"Ummm... master?\" Ananda interjected, \"I was thinking ... Maybe we should revisit that theory of inserting a line at the start of a file ...\"<br><br> The master gave Ananda a stern glance.  \"It is no theory Ananda, it is verily the way of nature.  One can only read, overwrite or append; one cannot insert.  These are the three modes of nature: 'r', 'w' and 'a'.  <em>There is no 'i'.</em>\"<br><br> Ananda sulked.<br><br> The master patted him.  \"No, Ananda, there are subtler forces at play here ...\"  </p></blockquote><hr><p><sub><strong>Notes:</strong><br>1.

I understand that this seems to be quite broad and many languages can fit to some degree, but my thought is, if there are still many candidates, then you might as well make the rules(clues given in the riddle) stricter and screen the candidates down. E.g. some said that the \"D\" line refers to D having local vs. global variables, but so many languages do, so you might want to look deeper into, say, variable naming conventions (clue: just an example, nothing to do with that).</p><p>Also, here are some additional clues:</p><p><strong>Age</strong></p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\"><p> The age is farther from B than all four guesses as of the time of writing.</p></blockquote><p><strong>How it treats vars</strong></p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\"><p> Think typing and stuff.</p></blockquote><p>Even more clues:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\"><p> Also think memory management.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Objects</strong><br/>Again, since few if any language is like E with respect to the object system, things remain pretty broad, so you may as well look at a certain aspect of it to screen candidates, more specifically,</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\"><p> the philosophy: E very strongly adheres to OOP.</p></blockquote><p>also, I might need to clarify that</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\"><p> objects can mean anything, but I did mean it in the OOP sense: an abstraction of a value (or set of values) with specific functions that are owned by and can operate on it (methods).</p></blockquote><p><strong>One more, really big clue</strong></p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\"><p> \"If it starts with F\" is actually trying to suggest the first letter in the language's name is important.</p></blockquote><p>With this one I probably made it too easy, though.</p><hr /><h2>The explanation</h2><p>So Chiel ten Brinke got it right, the correct answer is</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\"><p> Go (<a href=\"https://golang.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">official site</a>)(<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(programming_language)\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Wikipedia</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Little 'bout my age: far from that of B</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\"><p> Go was created in the 2009, just 7 years ago. The clue doesn't give a specific range, but at least one can expect no possible answer to be older than C.</p></blockquote><p>Yet in my syntax, you will find some C</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\"><p> Go's syntax, although pretty special in the family, is largely based off C, with C keywords, curly braces, operators, etc. Also, although there isn't always a semicolon after statements, they are just implicit, it's perfectly fine to use semicolons like in C, and that would be required to separate statements when doing inline stuff. However, that still doesn't throw C++, C#, Java, etc out of the pool of candidates.</p></blockquote><p>The way I treat vars, that is much like D</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\"><p> I stated in the extra clues that one should look at memory management and typing system. Now D has static, strong, inferred typing with automatic memory management (as in: delete vars when they are no longer needed). \"Inferred\" alone throws many languages out of the question, but since I didn't explicitly talk about type inference it is just a quite probable, but unconfirmed constraint. Automatic memory management filters out C++ and friends.</p></blockquote><p>I do take objects, but I'm not like E</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\"><p> In the extra clues I said the language was not like E that it doesn't adhere strongly to OOP, so C# and Java are out too, as well as Eiffel which was one of the answers you can find below. Go doesn't have classes, but structs can have methods, so OOP is pretty well supported, but the language itself doesn't emphasize OOP.</p></blockquote><p>If it starts with F, you'll know it's not me</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\"><p> In the extra clues, I mentioned that \"starts\" is trying to suggest that the first letter in the language's name is important. Now if you see that the riddle went all the way from B to F, and the first letter is important, it should be logically sound to think the language starts with G, the next letter in the sequence. That's not necessarily the way you should think, you can also say that it's Eiffel if not for the other clues. The other best candidates thus far, Rust and Swift, couldn't fit this.</p></blockquote><p>So in the end,</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\"><p> The ones who guessed Rust and Swift did very well, they only missed the BCDEF-G clue. Also, kudos to Klaws for suggesting Deesel, the answer only misinterpreted the line about E (it was about objects, not variables).</p></blockquote>",

Words respected each other and the big words always found a place among their smaller compatriots. The words worked together to weave letters into poetry and literature. </p><p>But just as every cheery summer is followed by a chilly winter, the good days of Dictionaria seem to be nearing an end as the newly powerful invaders from the dark depths of Chatsville go about destroying the natural beauty of Dictionaria.It started rather harmlessly when Laugh, Out and Loud found themselves marginalized as the petty thief Lol found his feet in Dictionaria. Brb came in and usurped the position long enjoyed by Be, Right and Back. There was almost no unease when these small time criminals began gaining recognition. But the worst was almost knocking on the door.</p><p>When Yolo and Twerking came charging through the gates, little did the natural words know that everything in Dictionaria would never be the same again. The popularity of these thugs grew by and large, and slowly they began claiming to be natural residents of Dictionaria. Led by the notorious mob boss Swag, the Usurpers from Chatsville have now decided to wipe out the older words of Dictionaria and claim the entire land as their own. </p><p>Swag has entrusted the task of complete domination to his two trusted henchmen - Xoxo, the sweet tongued monster and Asap, the swift executioner. Swag has ordered Xoxo and Asap to eliminate all words in an alphabetical order, killing words starting with a particular letter every day. Aardvark will be one of the first to go and millions more will soon follow.</p><p>Now, the henchmen are ruthless but not so bright and some of the words of Dictionaria have realized that they can escape the massacre simply if they manage to pass off as another word on their predestined day of execution. </p><p>These words are lucky to be born with such characteristics that they can contort their bodies to make their head appear where their foot is, and their foot appear where their head is. And once they escape their execution, they can live on because the henchmen will not remember which words have escaped their execution. These words hope to avoid death and one day drive out the Usurpers of Chatsville, but they need to know who their leader would be. As the natural words were respectful of those bigger than them, their leader would be the tallest one among them. </p><p>Who do you reckon will survive the massacre and lead the survivors?</p><p><strong>PUZZLE:</strong></p><p>Find the longest word in the English language that can be morphed into another word simply by switching its first and last letter. The word cannot have the same first and last letter. And the word cannot be an abbreviation or contraction. The word should be found on <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com\">Dictionary.com</a> and words that are valid in Scrabble are not counted if they do not appear on Dictionary.com.</p><hr><p><strong>EDIT:</strong></p><p>Dictionary.com is the bible of the residents of Dictionaria (hence the inspired name) and all those who seek to nominate non-existing words as the leaders are distrustful pagans.

The ladder is unbendable, cannot be cut by anything other than the saw, and cannot be mended once cut. It starts out as one solid piece of material. The saw cannot cut anything other than the ladder and there are no other materials around. I am capable of making precise cuts, if necessary.</p><p>In short, how do I use one of these:<br>$\\hskip1.5in$<img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/FhN2T.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><br>to double the length of one of these:<br>$\\hskip1.5in$<img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/4PogC.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></p><p>(It is necessary, for the intended solution, that the coping saw blade can be released on one side, threaded through an existing cut, and reattached; a keyhole saw would probably also work, but it would be difficult to make the necessary cut.

For all practical purposes, the question could have a truck of WEIGHT going over a bridge of GREAT LENGTH that has a weight limit of the same WEIGHT and it's traveled 80% of GREAT LENGTH when the bird lands.</li><li>The driver is not consuming or excreting anything besides the air within the cabin which is open to the atmosphere outside the cabin. It is irrelevant if it is open based on open windows or the air conditioning.</li><li>The truck has a diesel engine without any electrical source powerful enough to provide or significantly support locomotion.</li><li>The bridge can be treated as a perfectly rigid object with all stress equally distributed. The total weight it can handle is as posted in the original question.</li><li>During the truck's voyage across the bridge, there are no loads applied to the bridge besides the truck and the eventual landing of the bird. Yes, this means the bridge is the most sanitary outdoor construction of all time as no living things exist upon it's structure.</li><li>The truck weight is taken as the driver has just inhaled a full breath of air. Note that the bird weighs more than the weight of such a breath.</li><li>The bridge is perfectly smooth. The truck experiences no bumps or vibrations of any kind. There is no vertical movement of the truck at any point while traveling the bridge. Magic.</li></ol>",

Everyone shoots one by one, can shoot once and any person he wants. Smith always hits the target (100%) and shoots last. Brown hits the target 80% of the time and shoots second. Jones is the worst, hitting the target only 50% of the time and he shoots first. Who should Jones shoot in order to increase his chance of surviving?</p><hr><p><strong>Answer:</strong> Jones should shoot in the air. The worst shooter has the best chance of surviving in the triangular duel, which is Jones. After him goes Smith who never misses the target. Since Smith and Brown will be shooting each other when their turn comes, Jones must shoot no one until one of his enemies dies.</p><p>After that he shoots at his enemy, again having an advantage. First, it's easier to calculate the probability of surviving for Smith. In the duel with Brown he shoots first with a probability of 1/2. In this case he kills Brown. Brown also shoots first with a probability of 1/2.</p><p>Smith survives with a probability of 1/5. Thus, Smith will live over Brown with a probability of <strong>1/2 + 1/2 * 1/5 = 3/5</strong>. With a probability of 1/2, Smith survives the duel with Jones. All in all: the probability to survive for Smith is 3/5 * 1/2 = 3/10.</p><p>The probability for Brown to survive the duel with Smith is <strong>2/5</strong>.</p><p>Then Jones shoots Brown. In the first round, Brown has a probability of <strong>1/2 * 4/5 = 4/10</strong> to win. In the second round, he has a probability of <strong>1/2 * 1/5 * 1/2 * 4/5 = 4/100</strong>.</p><p>Thus, Brown has a chance to survive Jones: <strong>4/10 + 4/100 + 4/1000 + 4/10000 = 0.4444(4) = 4/9</strong>.</p><p>The probability of Brown to survive both of his opponents is equal to 2/5 (over Smith) * 4/9 (over Jones) = 8/45. The probability of Jones to survive = 1 - 3/10 - 8/45 = 47/90.</p><hr><p>In bold are the calculations I'm confused about and don't know how to arrive at. Can someone please explain it?

You don't know which lights are on or off to start with. The rooms happen to have the wall bordering the inside of the ring painted black and the wall bordering the outside of the ring painted white, so you can tell which direction is which.</p><p>Your job is to switch all the lights off, and once this is done, report to your boss via phone. The caveat is, if there is still a light on, you will be executed. The boss is also impatient, so you can't just keep walking forever.</p><p>Unfortunately, you suffer from short-term memory loss. Specifically, after <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-walking-through-doorway-makes-you-forget/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">walking through a door</a>, you can only remember a single integer between 1 and N<sup>#</sup> inclusive at any time, and must do so.

He did so about 1.5 hours before the captain was found dead.</li><li>The third was dressed as a water supply system engineer. He was caught on camera fixing a leak in the pipe which supplies water to the dining room. His body was such that the camera couldn't catch his tools. He did so about 5 hours before the captain was found dead.</li></ul><p>He found nothing suspicious about that information. The janitor cleans on schedule, the inspector inspected on schedule, and the pipe actually leaked.</p><p>The three are brought before the detective for questioning.</p><hr><p>\"Do you know each other?\"</p><p>They look at each other for a while and answer \"no\". Shortly afterwards, the second noticed the janitor was different. \"Hey, you're not any janitor I've seen,\" the second says. \"Perhaps he's a replacement?\" the third says. \"You're right, I was transferred from another ship. I replaced a janitor who died of a heart attack. This is the flagship anyway, I understand why I was brought here.\"</p><p>\"What were you doing 20 minutes before the captain was found dead?\"</p><p>The first answers, \"I was cleaning a bathroom in the control section.\"</p><p>The second answers, \"I was at my quarters, because I have completed the entire inspection schedule today.\"</p><p>The third answers, \"I was fixing another leak, on a pipe supplying water to the quarters.\"</p><p>\"Still inconclusive,\" thinks the detective. \"Guards, call the other detective.\"</p><hr><p>\"You\" are brought into action.

Whether it will ever happen in real life is debatable but it just  might.</p>    <p>@CR241 - The man is not wrestling. He is alone in the cages the whole  time.</p>    <p>@Displayname - The cages do not reach all the way to the guard house.  They are fairly close in size with a relatively small gap in between. It would  have been more sensible of me to make them square but all of the same  height. I just didn't think of that. The height just needs to be enough for them to be unclimbable.</p>    <p>@fakedad - You ask if the geometry of the cages is important. On  thinking about it, I've added that tag. So yes. However he can't climb  or break out and the only exit to each cage is its door. That is why  he needed the keys.</p>    <p>@Hugh - Having looked at the definition of the story tag, I don't  <em>think</em> it comes under that category. Clearly there is a story involved but I'd say this is more of a situation. I'll look into this  further though.</p>    <p>@JimM - The locks and keys are well-maintained and are just normal ones that open easily with no special tricks or time-limits. The man can open or lock them at will.</p>    <p>@Steve V. - As long as the man is constrained to leave by the doors and can't break or bend or damage anything it doesn't matter what the cages are made of.</p></blockquote>",

They ran to a nearby forest and then all slept there for the night. They didn't count how many diamonds there were in the bag, but anyway there can't be more than 400 diamonds in the bag since that's the bag maximum capacity.</p></blockquote><ul><li>A thief wins the initiative roll, wakes up and runs away, but as soon as he tries to escape, a second thief catches him, and the second thief decides to divide the loot in 2. Unluckily, the remainder is 1 diamond.</li><li>Meanwhile another thief wakes up and then tries to divide the loot, but as soon as he divides it the remainder is 2 diamonds.</li><li>The 4th and 5th and 6th and 7th thieves wake up one by one. Each time the new thief tries to divide the loot equally, but they get 3, 4, 5, 6 diamonds as remainders, respectively.</li><li>The last thief (7th and last to attempt loot division) then decides to give up the remainder to the other thieves before they even attempt to do some modulus calculations. Anyway only 1 thief is richer than him now.</li></ul><p>Tell how many diamonds were in the bag and what happened.</p><p><strong>Cheat:</strong></p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> Notice the emphasis and try to be on my side, I couldn't find a perfect fit, so I took the most immediate fit. Calculations are correct.</p></blockquote><p>P.S.</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> D&D stuff is just scenic.</p></blockquote><p>Here's a list of what happens to make it even more clear (and thanks for comments!:) )</p><ol><li>Thief 1, try to escape</li><li>Thief 2 stop the 1st and attempt division (remainder 1)</li><li>Thief 3 stop the 1st,2nd and attempt division (remainder 2)</li></ol><p>And so on..</p><ol><li>Thief 7 stop all previous thief and attempt division (remainder 6), then he distributes the remainder to the other thieves (1 diamond to thieves numbered from 1 to 6)</li></ol><p>Before robbing the shop, the thieves have no money, and each diamond has equal value to other diamonds.</p><hr><p><a href=\"https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/35650/11581\">@GarethMcCaughan</a> came up with the correct lateral thinking in his answer, however his solution (correct and acceptable, if no one find the elegant solution) is more complicated than needed (Indeed, I'm impressed by his skill, and I'm leaving open the chance to find the best answer!)</p><p><a href=\"https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/35681/11581\">@Realdeo</a> was succesfully in finding a exotic and fun explaination for the 7th thief returning part of the loot (though it is not the correct answer), I really enjoyed that answer from another D&D player.</p><p>Additional hint:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> There is a precise reason for wich the last thief give up the remainder. Indeed every thief don't know if others cheat and by wich quantity cheat. If you think in wich way I could create a puzzle like this you will find the simplest possible solution.</p></blockquote>",

        "Body": "<p>Alice and Bob are going on a game show as partners. In this game, there are three doors, which contain a car, the car keys, and a goat, which are arranged randomly and secretly behind the doors. Alice will go onstage first and open two doors and then shut them, while Bob remains backstage in a soundproof booth (he cannot gain any further information about what doors were opened or what they contained). Alice is then led to her own soundproof booth, after which Bob goes onstage and opens two doors. Alice and Bob win the game if Alice finds the car and Bob finds the car keys, while any other outcome results in a loss. The pair are given time to strategize before the game begins.</p><p>What is the optimal strategy, and what is the likelihood the pair will win? Without strategizing (i.e., by choosing doors at random), Alice has a 2/3 chance of finding the car, and Bob has a 2/3 chance of finding the keys, for a total win probability of 4/9. But the pair can win with higher likelihood - how?</p><p>To clarify a few points: Alice and Bob do not know what is behind any door before opening it, and opening a door reveals only the contents of that door. The prizes behind the doors do not move between rounds. Bob has no way of inferring what doors Alice opened or what she found behind them, other than whatever their previously agreed-upon strategy dictates. And while I've called this a Monty Hall problem due to the doors and prizes, Monty himself does not play any role in this game.</p><p>This puzzle adapted from  <em>Surprises in Probability- Seventeen Short Stories</em>, by Henk Tijms.</p>",

Then Grey Beaver took a knife from a sheath that hung around his neck, and went into the thicket and cut a stick. <strong>[Book title]</strong> watched him. </li></ol><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> <em>The cub</em> and <em>man-animals</em> hint at an animal story, and specifically, one told from the animal perspective. <em>Grey Beaver</em> sounds like a Native American name / nickname. Combine the two to get <em>White Fang</em> by Jack London.</p></blockquote><ol start=\"2\"><li>We have devoted several centuries to inventing and elaborating <strong>[book title]</strong> as a universal language and method for expressing all intellectual concepts and all artistic values and reducing them to a common denominator.</li></ol><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> The title of the book <em>is</em> a universal language system and <em>is</em> a method of expressing both science and art. Few authors have dared to combine science and art in one action, and even fewer named their books after such actions. The answer is <em>The Glass Bead Game</em> by Herman Hesse.</p></blockquote><ol start=\"3\"><li>The human beings did not hate <strong>[book title]</strong> any less now that it was prospering; indeed, they hated it more than ever. Every human being held it as an article of faith that the <strong>[book title]</strong> would go bankrupt sooner or later, and, above all, that the windmill would be a failure. They would meet in the public-houses and prove to one another by means of diagrams that the windmill was bound to fall down, or that if it did stand up, then that it would never work. </li></ol><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> Again, <em>human beings</em> are contrasted to the main characters of the work of fiction, so they might be animals. If [book title] can go bankrupt, it should have a kind of <em>company</em>, <em>enterprize</em>, <em>factory</em> etc in the title. Combine to get <em>Animal Farm</em> by George Orwell.</p></blockquote><ol start=\"4\"><li>I have to catch everybody if they start to go over the cliff—I mean if they’re running and they don’t look where they’re going I have to come out from somewhere and catch them. That’s all I’d do all day. I’d just be <strong>[book title]</strong> and all. I know it’s crazy, but that’s the only thing I’d really like to be. I know it’s crazy.</li></ol><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> A monologue declares that the character wants to be <em>someone</em>, and his main responsibility will be to catch people. Naturally, he is a <em>catcher</em>, specifically, <em>The Catcher in the Rye</em> by J. D. Salinger.</p></blockquote><ol start=\"5\"><li><p>\"Can't we,\" he pleaded to the world, to himself, to the officials, to the Machine, \"can't we take it back, can't we make it alive again? Can't we start over? Can't we-\" </p><p>He did not move. Eyes shut, he waited, shivering. He heard Travis breathe loud in the room; he heard Travis shift his rifle, click the safety catch, and raise the weapon. </p><p>There was <strong>[book title]</strong>.</p></li></ol><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> <em>Making alive again</em> and <em>starting over</em> hints at time travel stories. Then, in the second paragraph, <em>sounds</em> are thouroughly listed: <em>loud breathing</em>, <em>shifting a rifle</em>, <em>clicking the catch</em>; we are safe to assume that the book title will have a sound. Specifically, <em>A Sound of Thunder</em> by Ray Bradbury.</p></blockquote><ol start=\"6\"><li><p>“You are a silly little boy,” said the <strong>[book title]</strong>, “just an ignorant, silly little boy.” </p><p>Simon moved his swollen tongue but said nothing. </p><p>“Don’t you agree?” said the <strong>[book title]</strong>. “Aren’t you just a silly little boy?” </p><p>Simon answered him in the same silent voice. </p><p>“Well then,” said the <strong>[book title]</strong>, “you’d better run off and play with the others. They think you’re batty. You don’t want Ralph to think you’re batty, do you? You like Ralph a lot, don’t you? And Piggy, and Jack?”</p></li></ol><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> A work of art clearly depicting little boys and their wrongdoings. Too much conflict to be <em>Peter Pan</em>. It's <em>Lord of the Flies</em> by William Golding.</p></blockquote><ol start=\"7\"><li>I’d rather you shot at tin cans in the back yard, but I know you’ll go after birds. Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit ‘em, but remember it’s a sin <strong>[book title]</strong>.</li></ol><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> More of a construction puzzle, this one. The book title clearly has a verb first and a bird to contrast <em>bluejays</em> second. It's <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em> by Harper Lee.</p></blockquote><ol start=\"8\"><li><p>Goodby Miss Kinnian and dr Strauss and evrybody…</p><p>PS. please tel prof Nemur not to be such a grouch when pepul laff at him and he woud have more frends. Its easy to have frends if you let pepul laff at you. Im going to have lots of frends where I go.</p><p>PPS. please if you get a chanse put some <strong>[book tilte]</strong> grave in the bak yard.</p></li></ol><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> If a characteristic spelling, intentionally left out even in the placeholder, does not give this one away, think of things that are typically put at the graves. Food? Books? Anyway, flowers come to my mind first. Seeking for a work of fiction with <em>Flowers</em> in the title, it's <em>Flowers for Algernon</em> by Daniel Keyes.</p></blockquote><ol start=\"9\"><li>“The common people pray for rain, healthy children, and a summer that never ends,” Ser Jorah told her. “It is no matter to them if the high lords play their <strong>[book title]</strong>, so long as they are left in peace.”</li></ol><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> First, there's <em>something</em> that high lords <em>play</em>, so we have a good chance of guessing right by looking for titles containing <em>Game</em>. A medieval fantasy series with lots of high lords? <em>Game of Thrones</em> by George R. R. Martin.</p></blockquote><ol start=\"10\"><li><p>One of the recurring philosophical questions is: “Does a falling tree in the forest make a sound when there is no one to hear?”</p><p>Which says something about the nature of philosophers, because there is always someone in a forest. It may only be a badger, wondering what that cracking noise was, or a squirrel a bit puzzled by all the scenery going upwards, but someone. At the very least, if it was deep enough in the forest, millions of <strong>[book title]</strong> would have heard it.</p></li></ol><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> Might be the hardest ones. Who hears the sound in the forest, but for the people and animals? Insects? Possibly. Supernatural beings? More fitting for the title of a book raising philosophical questions. Millions of supernatural beings? <em>Small Gods</em> by Terry Pratchett.</p></blockquote><h2>Request</h2><p>Try finding the answers without looking up in the Internet. I am fully aware that search engines trivialize this puzzle to the point where it can be done programmatically. However, I believe my examples have all the clues needed to answer the questions on your own.</p><p>Do provide some feedback: was it hard or not? </p><p>If you can, please suggest more books that can be plausibly used in the puzzle.</p><p>EDIT. Most of the book titles have been correctly answered at this point. I'm updating the post with hints and answers. I'll still be happy with feedback.</p>",

In case of multiple eligible letters, you may highlight any, as this is not relevant to finding the solution, i.e. <code>CARPAL</code> could be CAR<sub>PAL</sub> or C<sub>A</sub>R<sub>P</sub>A<sub>L</sub>.<br>Therefore, an example answer could be:</p><blockquote>  <p>Alpine ...  </p>    <p>PAL, IEN, ...  </p>    <hr>    <ol>  <li>CAR<sub>P</sub><sub>AL</sub> - <em>definition here...</em></li>  <li>H<sub>I</sub>DD<sub>EN</sub> - <em>another definition here...</em></li>  <li>...  </li>  </ol></blockquote><p>Again, apart from the single request I've made, any formatting choice is up to you.</p></li><li>You may safely ignore the inscription written around the center when solving the puzzle (while still appreciating the many years of experience of the author). </li></ol><hr><h1>Puzzle</h1><p>         <a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zwuvm.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Zwuvm.png\" alt=\"The dice star, preparing to destroy the Ivory moon of Gammon II\"></a></p><h2>Definitions</h2><blockquote>  <p>You, turned to meat. — Ones who cut stone. — Those who eat. — A maiden quite fat. — Remove mammalian garden pests. — Formed of natural fiber — Hopefully you, by a ruby kipper. — Foliage under the weather — Moved sneakily. — People Who Found Jenny's number.  — A bowdlerized British bird... according to a deal-making snake — First Generation water-related pocket monster — What a puzzle solver does, given incomplete information. — Made up for. — An arcade fighter. — Missing to an abnormal degree, esp.

        "Body": "<p>(I created this variant of a classic puzzle a long time ago, before the movie HPCOS was released.)</p><p>Enough is enough. You've decided it's time to take a stand. Every year since that boy started attending Hogwarts, Dumbledore has given the House cup to Gryffindor by a \"last minute awarding\" of large numbers of points to him for ever more dubious reasons. The Gryffindors have even stopped trying, knowing that they'll get the cup no matter what happens. This year, Dumbledore has just announced an award of 400 points to the boy \"for parting his hair in a most interesting way\", taking the cup away from your own house of Hufflepuff. </p><p>So you've confronted Dumbledore, and not only your own house, but also all the Ravenclaws and Slytherins have joined you. Even the Gryffindors look embarassed. \"So, young Hufflepuff. I've been partial, have I? Well, then, let's put this nonsense to rest. We'll have a contest, between you and our fine Gryffindor champion. Mr. Finch! Bring the Urns of Peano from my office!\" Finch comes back carrying 3 large urns, and Dumbledore calls the two of you forward. You see that two of the urns are empty while the third is full of balls with numbers printed in a strange magical script. Indeed, you pull one out of the top and try to read the number, but it keeps going on around the ball repeatedly, yet somehow without ever overlapping itself. Finally you give up and put it back. Dumbledore explains \"In this urn is a ball for every natural number. Yes, infinitely many - a wonderful magic. As you can see, each of the urns has a dispenser track on the bottom where the lowest ten values in the urn are displayed. Go ahead, take the first ball.\" You pick it up and find the number 0. When you drop it back in the top of the urn, suddenly the balls on the track back up a space, while the 0 ball rolls through them to its original position.</p><p>\"The contest\", Dumbledore explains, \"is this: Each of your houses are assigned one of the empty urns. The two of you will act in turns. In each round, you, young Hufflepuff,\" (you suspect he doesn't even know your name) \"will take two balls from the track and place them in the Hufflepuff urn. Then our fine Gryffindor here will take a single ball from the Hufflepuff urn, and move it to the Gryffindor urn. This will continue until one of you can no longer take your turn.\" \"But, won't that take forever?\" asks your opponent. \"Indeed, it would\", Dumbledore replies, \"But I shall cast 'Zeno's Accelerator' upon you. Fix a strategy in your mind, and when I cast the spell, your hands will follow it automatically. Each round will take but half the time of the round before, until an infinite number of rounds have been completed. In this way, the entirety of the urn may be emptied in only twice as much time as the first round takes.\" Your opponent's egghead friend can no longer contain herself. \"That's ridiculous! The energy it would take is infinite! The heat produced would kill us all!\". \"Honestly, young lady,\", Dumbledore replies, \"you should have learned by now that muggle physics takes a back seat to magic!\" The Gryffindor champion still appears confused. \"But, sir, if in every round, two balls are added to Hufflepuff, and I take one of them to put in Gryffindor, how will either house pull ahead? We'll just be tied in the end!\"</p><p>\"Oh, no, Gryffindor. You misapprehend! If even one ball remains in the Hufflepuff urn when the contest ends, Hufflepuff will be declared the winner. Let them accuse me of favoritism now!\" Your opponent looks very nervous, but suddenly appears to listen to something and calm down. A glance shows his egghead friend whispering something, apparently using a teleloquela charm. Obviously the fix is in. But fortunately, it appears that you've paid more attention to your arithmancy classes than Dumbledore did, for you spot a flaw in his plan. You smile as you fix your strategy in mind.</p><p>Why does Dumbledore expect Gryffindor to win? And what strategy can you use to defeat him?</p>",

However, you have the following restrictions:</p><ul><li><p>you always have to add one letter and change one letter</p></li><li><p>you can't add a letter and then change it in the same move</p></li></ul><p>To be absolutely clear on that last rule: a move isn't allowed if it is possible to get from the longer word to the shorter one just by removing one letter.

        "Body": "<p>Last year, December 21, 2013, you were awarded the \"#1 Detective in the World\" for solving more than 50 murders. Your boss gave you a promotion, contingent upon your moving to Chicago. You agreed and took your new position. Your boss told you that you would be taking a plane to Chicago, the ticket and everything already having been paid for by your boss. He also told you that you would be taking off on January 15, 2014.</p><p>All of a sudden, all you heard was a loud beeping sound. \"BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP BEEP\", as your eyes open wide. You got up and realized it was your alarm clock going off. 6:30 AM. You turned the alarm off, did a big stretch and gave a big yawn. \"Why do I keep having the same dream about the day that I got promoted?\" you pondered to yourself. Without giving it another thought, you got out of bed and started getting ready for your day.</p><p>You got to work and went straight to your office. As soon as you sat down you heard a knock on your office door. \"Come in,\" you said.</p><p>Your assistant opened the door. \"You're needed at the intersection of Main and Peele.\" You weren't surprised to hear this. You quickly got up and drove to the location.</p><p>When you got there, there were 3-4 police cars, yellow \"Police Line\" tape, and a large crowd gathered around the intersection. You got out of the car and walked towards the scene. As you got closer, you could see a body covered with a blanket, and other police and detectives talking and taking pictures.</p><p>\"Morning. It seems like this man here was murdered,\" said one of the other detectives.</p><p>You lifted the blanket to see that the man had been stabbed three times, had two gunshot wounds to his left hip, and had red markings around his neck. \"It looks like he has been strangled with rope as well,\" you said as you kept on examining his body.</p><p>You covered the body back up with the blanket. You looked around and saw that there were small yellow cones with numbers on them, and beside each cone you saw an object. You walked over to one of the cones. It had the number \"4\" on it. You looked beside the cone and saw perfect circular blood drops. You then walked over to the number \"2\" cone, seeing a knife with no blood on it. Cone number \"3\" was beside a piece of paper. On it was \"He Deserved It! 1H8H1M\". You looked closely at \"1H8H1M\" and wondered what that meant. You stood there and pondered it for a minute, then moved on to cone number \"1\". The last cone was beside a shoe print. It was mud which produced the prints. The shoe size looked to be a size 9 men's shoe.</p><p>\"I've seen enough. I'm heading back to my office\" you told the other detectives.</p><p>The next day, your assistant told you that the forensics lab had asked you to visit them when you had the chance. You headed over to the forensics lab.</p><p>\"Hello, you must be the great detective. Nice to meet you!\" said the forensic technician. \"The results are back. There were no fingerprints on the note. The knife was clean like it was brand new straight from the box. The shoe print was of a size 9 men's shoe. But the most interesting part is that the blood stains are not human. It's animal blood. Specifically from a poodle.\"</p><p>As you pondered the information that the technician had told you, your cell phone rang. You answered it. \"We have found a few suspects here at the station. Please come ASAP.\"</p><p>You rushed over to the station. As you drove over there, you got violently cut off by another driver and almost crashed. \"Learn how to drive!\" the man in the other car yelled as he drove away. You caught a glimpse of a man with shaggy brown hair, small nose, and big ears. You took a deep breath and continued on.</p><p>When you arrived at the station you saw that the police had gathered three suspects: a white man between the age of 22-26, short black hair, with a toned build; a tall blonde female, wearing a fancy dress and jewelry like she was going on a date or to a party; and a skinny homeless man wearing very battered clothing, with long greasy hair and a full beard. </p><p>The twenty-something man said that he was at the bank getting some money three blocks away from the murder site around the same time the murder was reported.</p><p>The blonde female said that she was going for a run around the block as she just lived down the street from the murder site. She made one round around the block, then decided to do another round. As she was jogging she saw the crowd and decided to stop and take a look.</p><p>The homeless man didn't speak English well and seemed kinda crazy. \"I did no murder. I asking for money for food. Hungry, haven't eat couple days.\" </p><p>You went back to your office and pondered about the clues and information from the murder scene, the forensics lab, and the suspects. After pondering a while you figured out who the murderer was. You quickly rushed back to the police station and told the police to arrest the person.</p><p>Who was the murderer?</p>",

His sight had already left him, and he could still see silhouettes and shadows, but communication in sign language with his niece was getting more and more complicated.</p><p>Nevertheless, they decided to go.</p><p>They left on a small boat, one of those tourist trips on a sailboat. There were 10 people on the boat, including them.</p><p>They were approaching a very nice archipelago when it began.</p><p>A storm, a powerful one, overturned the boat, leaving the crew in the ocean to struggle for life. The niece, although chubby and weak, managed to rescue her grandfather and reach a deserted little island in the archipelago with other 3 people. The sea halved them, but still there was hope.</p><p>Days passed with very low food. Our two tourists were weak and hungry and only a little water supply was available. After a week one of the man said that he would begin to hunt for seagulls, of which the island had a lot. The old man only saw a big black cloud talking, the salt and sand had only worsen his sight, and, beaten by hunger, promptly said \"<em>Yes...please...</em>\".</p><p>Apparently, the hunter was a very good one. Finally they could eat something, and could also eat it cooked since a fire was lit up by one of the survivors.</p><p>A few other days passed. The seagulls were manna for them, but not enough to give them strength to move. All the day the old man sat beneath a palm thinking \"<em>This is not how I wanted to see them...</em>\".</p><p>Suddenly a great \"<em>WOO</em>\" echoed in the archipelago. A cruise ship. A cruise ship! They waved vigorously, everyone beside the old man, he was too weak. The ship arrived and collected them all.</p><p>\"<em>We are safe!</em>\" thought the old man. Then, with his heart in peace, he fell asleep, only to wake up in the medical wing of the ship.</p><p>\"<em>Come, my friend, it's time for you to eat something good!</em>\" said the captain. They went to the restaurant and the old man couldn't believe his eyes and almost cried to the signboard at the entry:</p><p><em>TODAY'S SPECIAL: SEAGULL MEAT!</em></p><p>\"<em>Well, at least it will be well cooked,</em>\" he thought.

The staff of recursion he held wasincredibly powerful and could do great damage in the wrong hands. Infact, it just had. One wave of the wand and you could use as manycopies of a function as you like. Wave again, they all disappear. Wave it wrong, well…<br />A yell came from somewhere behind him. He, the standardoperations, and the jesters had been searchingthe ruins for at least two hours. It wasDivision who had found the singular, shivering constant. All others hadvanished.</em></p></blockquote><p>Standard procedure in world-altering times is for the musketeers/operations to round up as many numbers as they can and protect them. Then if disaster strikes, the values can be used to construct all whole numbers from 1-100. Four numbers or more are usually enough to do the trick, and sometimes they get extra.</p><p>But one of the citizens of the number kingdom had gotten upset, and grabbed at Factorial's scepter. The only number spared was around ~2.6854, by sheer luck. Operations like Addition were rendered impossible without more than one value. However, the actions of Factorial the wizard, Sir Square Root, and the royal jesters Floor and Ceiling meant it was still possible to get an array of values.</p><h4> *Can you get all values from 1-100, and possibly 101-120, using only factorials, square roots, and rounding, and a single instance of the luckless Khinchin's constant which lies between 2 and 3?* </h4>     <p><strong>Factorials can only be applied to integers.</strong>  You will probably need factorials bigger than 170. This can be done using Desmos graphing calculator and a bit of exploration. Don't forget, if you get a number, you can use it as an intermediary for other numbers, e.g:<br /><b> 5040 = 7! </b><br />You don’t have to write out the expansion for 7 twice as long as you have it in your answer elsewhere. But you can't use 7+7 because that would use 2.6 twice. You could also write out:</p><p><span class=\"math-container\">$\\sqrt[2^{997}]{(166!)!}$</span></p><p>to imply 997 square roots in a row. Even though you have neither a 2 nor a 997, you can still perform that operation because square roots use no numbers. However, you still need to achieve 166 somehow.You do not have to take either of these options; however, I highly recommend you take at least one, as the massive chains of square roots get unwieldy fast. I took the first option.</p><hr /><p><sup> <em>This puzzle came to be from <a href=\"https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/118384/make-the-numbers-1-100-using-1-7-3-4\">this number formations puzzle</a>.

Dominator  Furbles can fight for a breeding territory, and if they win, will be  able to rear 10 offspring.  An alternative is to share territory with  another Furble which will allow each to rear 5 offspring.  Sharers who  attempt to share with dominators will be forced out of the territory,  although they will be able to find a new territory.  Assume sharers  become extra cautious after encountering a dominator and so will  always find another territory to share the next time around, but due  to lost time will only be able to produce 3 offspring.  Dominators are  always able to force sharers out of the territory and rear 10 young.   Dominators who meet dominators will win 50% of the time.  When they  lose, they are not able to reproduce that season due to sustained  injuries.  Individual Furbles cannot switch strategies.  </p>    <p>With a total population of 2000 dominator and sharer Furbles  altogether, how many would you expect to dominate?</p></blockquote><p>I would assume no Furble finds an empty location.

He made a fortune locating the best honey you could find anywhere in the world and selling it to people who can afford to pay ridiculous prices for a minuscule jar of honey.

I mean, who doesn't like bees?  Who wouldn't like to spend a night surrounded by the soft humming of bees?  Or better, who wouldn't like to live like a bee for a night?  So he decided that he would build the first hotel for bee lovers.</p><p>He pays a visit to an architect friend and brings along the concept he drafted for his hotel.

First you need an entrance somewhere on the outer wall.  Then you will have to replace some rooms with hallways.

She is good at these things.</li></ul><p>So, dear reader, how would you solve Dr. Bees' problem?</p><ul><li>You can see a preliminary plan of the hotel.  Bees represent hotel rooms.</li><li>You have to replace a number of rooms with hallways in order to provide a path from each room to a single main entrance.  This means that the hallways must form a connected region and at least one of them must lie on the perimeter of the hexagon.</li><li>Every remaining room must be adjacent to at least one hallway.</li><li>The number of rooms converted to hallways must be minimal.</li></ul><p>So, what is the minimum of hallways the hotel needs?  Show how it can be done.</p><p><strong>Clarification</strong></p><p>Some solutions assume the outer rooms don't need an access to a hallway since they can have a door to the outside.  While this is arguably what Dr. Bees would prefer, it is not what the puzzle asks you to solve.  It explicitly says that all rooms must be adjacent to a hallway and the hallways must form a connected region.</p><p>I will add to the specifications that the outside of the hotel must not be considered a giant hallway.</p><p>This is my own creation.

He just came back from a trip to the western world and he was thrown out from nearly all the parties... just because he refused to do all those hard math riddles. Seriously, he felt so insulted by their insolence... yet also strangely inspired! He would right this wrong directly! As soon as he gets back in his castle he calls in his head of guards to devise a new password scheme.</p><hr><p>A merchant comes and the guards ask him</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p>Original version... containing a mistake... see comment on accepted answer :'( : <em>Kind merchant, what brings you to our gates?</em></p></blockquote><p><br></p><blockquote>  <p>Kind merchant, what is it that brings you here?</p></blockquote><p>The merchant closes his eyes for a bit and says</p><blockquote>  <p>Trade and wares for our sovereign, my fair guards.</p></blockquote><p>And they let him right in.</p><hr><p>Behind the merchant a couple of spies for a neighboring nation were waiting to be let in. They had come and gone from the city many times, but they grew suspicious as the guards were behaving differently from other days and turned around to listen for awhile from far away whilst acting as if they were waiting for a bit.</p><hr><p>A monk arrives at the gate, and the first guard says</p><blockquote>  <p>Father, it shames us that we have to ask this of you, but what...</p></blockquote><p>And the second guard continues</p><blockquote>  <p>... brings thee here?</p></blockquote><p>And the monk answers</p><blockquote>  <p>It is quite all right my children, I have heard of this new scheme your rex has thought of. Be that as it may be, I will be here for awhile, if you need my help or advice, visit me at the monastery.</p></blockquote><p>And walks right in.</p><hr><p>A forester arrives at the gate and says</p><blockquote>  <p>Do you really need to ask me again? I have left and entered all the time.</p></blockquote><p>Guard</p><blockquote>  <p>Yes, Yes, we do.</p></blockquote><p>And the forester sighs</p><blockquote>  <p>That king of ours... as much as I love him, sometimes... <em>sigh</em></p></blockquote><p>And the guards chuckle to each other and let him right in.</p><hr><p>A beggar arrives at the gate</p><blockquote>  <p>Don't come to our city! Not like a piece of filth like you will know our password! If you knew you would just spoil it.</p></blockquote><p>The first guard exclaims. The second guard gives an irritated stare at his companion and kindly says</p><blockquote>  <p>Well... he is half right, do you?</p></blockquote><p>The beggar, doesn't even wait to think and starts answering directly</p><blockquote>  <p>Yes of course I do... the monarch... ehm... I have heard it from our own monarchs mouth when he announced it last week. I may be cripple and without arms, but I am not an idiot! </p></blockquote><p>And in he goes.</p><hr><p>For two hours nobody turns up at the gate, before the unloved mother in law of the second guard turns up.</p><blockquote>  <p>Welcome back, need help?</p></blockquote><p>The first one says kindly, seeing she is pushing in a cart that's far too heavy for her. The lady smiles kindly at him and is about to answer when the second interjects</p><blockquote>  <p>What brings you here to our gate at night?</p></blockquote><p>The lady halts, thinks for a bit, then scowls at her daughters husband angrily before thinking for a bit longer before answering half afraid:</p><blockquote>  <p>It is all to honour our kind and just and fair overlord of course...</p></blockquote><p>And the second guard replies</p><blockquote>  <p>You dare call our fair King an overlord?! You...</p></blockquote><p>Before the first interjects and whilst helping her in through the gate says to the second guard</p><blockquote>  <p>You ass! She did not deserve that! If you ever do something like that again I will seriously tell your wife!</p></blockquote><p>At which point the second guard goes white with fear.</p><hr><p>During the exchange one of the spies looks at the other and says</p><blockquote>  <p>I know it! It's so simple! This sounds <em>just</em> like that king of theirs!</p></blockquote><p>He walks up to the guards and they say</p><blockquote>  <p>So, decided to return after all? Hiding in the trees and everything...</p></blockquote><p>And the second continues with</p><blockquote>  <p>Anything you wish to say for yourself?</p></blockquote><p>The spy looks doubtful for a bit... goes silent... and then exclaims</p><blockquote>  <p>His Majesty!

To solve this riddle, you'll need patience. Each sub-riddle will be harder than the last; where the final riddle will prove to be difficult indeed as you'll need to get creative, and reflect on what you've learned.</p><p>I'll start us off easy with animal number one.

If the accepted answer does not contain the pattern I used, then I will add <a href=\"https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/69686/hunting-season-is-open/69786#69786\">my own answer</a> to explain it.</p><p>As a final request, I would like to know what you thought of my riddles with your answer; did they make you think?

He repeats this theft another two times, removing altogether nine pints and replacing them with water. As a result of this swindle, the diluted wine remaining in the barrel lost half of its former strength.</p>    <p>How much wine was in the barrel before the thievery began?</p></blockquote><p>(Note: Tartaglia is also famous for his solution of the cubic equation. The cubic equation that is implicit in this puzzle, however, is of a simple form that could be solved already before Tartaglia's work.)</p>",

        "Body": "<p>This is a very hot summer in Rome and you don't know what to do. You are the best detective in town but no crime seems to happen. You are all the day in front of your PC trying to solve some puzzles about parties and elephants but you can't find any solution so far. You are on the way to solving the 20th when a young policeman rushes into your room and gives you a letter. <br/><br/>\"Get the hell out! I had the solution of that devilish puzzle and now it is gone! Get out!\"<br/><br/>He can't understand your frustration and closes the door as fast as he could. Anyway, you opened up the letter and started to read:</p><pre><code>Rome, 22/7/14AHAHA Mr. Rossi, I have planted a bomb into the Colosseum! It will explode tonight at 24:00. I know you are a puzzle-lover, so I would give you a chance to defuse it. Go there andand follow the instructions, every clue is important, so be focused! You will find a 6-fold piece of paper with some hints to crack the bomb!Good Luck!The evil bomber</code></pre><p><br/>\"Accipicchia [Oh my gosh]\" you said \"I need to move!\" <br/><br/>You started to run to the Colosseum and after 20 minutes you found the bomb and the instruction. There is a keyboard and a monitor linked to the bomb. On the screen, you can see a textbox which allows you to type in just 4 characters and big red text saying: \"Enter the password\".<br/>You opened up the piece of paper and started to read the hint.<br/><br/></p><pre><code>Let's do some math: 2^2 = ...3^2 = ... 5^2 = ...7^2 = ...11^2 = ...You can choose to stop here or keep on with all the prime numbers you can evaluate!Now you should know the password!The evil bomber</code></pre><p>You started to think about for a while and after 20 minutes you started to type the solution that came up in your mind. After you pressed enter, on the screen you saw <strong>\"The bomb has been defused!\"</strong><br/><br/>\"Perbacco [My goodnees], I made it! Now I need to find the solution of the 20th party!\".<br/><br/></p><p><strong>The puzzle:</strong><br/>What is the password and how did he come up with that?</p><p><strong>Edit:</strong><br/>Let's add some hints to help you to find the right solution.</p><p><strong>Hint #1</strong><br/></p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p>The evil bomber is a PhD in Math, but he did not find any job and he started his career as a terrorist. Loving numbers, every number he gave are there for a reason, but one, just to make him struggle a little more.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Hint #2</strong><br/></p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> Mr. Rossi is a fan of Math History, he loves <a href=\"https://hsm.stackexchange.com/\">HSM</a> too. He found in a while which \"subject\" of the hints the evil bomber gave to him. It was easy, every numbers are linked univocally to that subject. It was easy to type the right answer this way.  </p></blockquote><p><strong>Hint #3</strong><br/></p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> During his PhD, the evil bomber studied a lot <a href=\"http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EulerProduct.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Euler</a>, Reimann, and their <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Euler-Reimann Z function.</a> He found with joy they are related to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi#Number_theory_and_Riemann_zeta_function\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">PI</a>. </p></blockquote><p><strong>Reference</strong></p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> You can find at <a href=\"http://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi_greco#Analisi\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">prodotto di Eulero</a> the relation between primes and $\\pi$.

Each player has the same 5 cards, showing A, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (Ace being low). Each player then has to choose a single card from their hand.</p><p>The objective of the game is to choose the <strong>lowest unique card</strong> that is displayed in the round. If two or more people show the same numbered card, they will not win. If no one chooses a card unique from anyone else, then the round is repeated until someone has a uniquely numbered card.</p><p>Each of them has 55 seconds to decide which card they want to draw, at which point they must each in turn show what they have picked. No one else knows which card anyone else has picked until they are displayed at the end of the time limit, but they are allowed to communicate with each other during that period.</p><p>The competent logician has to come up with a logical solution for which card to choose to maximize his chance of winning. What card should he choose? If the round needs to be repeated, should he choose the same card again?</p><hr><p><strong>Note</strong>: Whilst I do have a specific \"correct\" answer in mind, it is not necessarily the one that I will choose, as any card could reasonably be chosen and win, or lose. I'll accept the answer that is accompanied by the best logical argument for the choice of card.</p><p><strong>Edit</strong>: To clarify, he has never played this game with any of his friends before, so he has no idea how they will initially think to play the game. He is unable to make any assumptions about their possible strategies, he is on the same playing field as they are, he simply needs his own strategy that he believes will give him an edge.</p><p><strong>Edit 2:</strong> I should also clarify that this is only for the first game that they play. Only one game (with potentially multiple rounds) needs to be played until there is a winner. Once the game begins to be repeated the strategies will evolve based on what each person sees that the others are choosing. This question is for the first game only.</p>",

Those fiddly little non-tactile touchscreen \"keys\" are impossible to <em>touch</em>-type on, so I have to revert to the one-finger \"hunt and peck\" method, which is slow.  I wonder if an alternative keyboard layout would make things easier.</p><p>So, my challenge here is to design a keyboard layout (two-dimensional arrangement of the 26 letters of the English alphabet) that <strong>maximizes the frequency for which adjacent letters in English words are on adjacent keys of the keyboard.</strong>  So, frequent letter pairs, like T-H or A-N, should be next to each other.</p><p>I will post at least one of my own answers, but will not give myself the checkmark.</p><h1>Defining “adjacent”</h1><ul><li>On <a href=\"http://docs.geotools.org/latest/userguide/_images/grid_hex_angled.png\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a hexagonal grid</a> or <a href=\"https://www.houseplanshelper.com/images/brick_pattern_staggared_offset.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a staggered rectangular grid</a>, where each key touches six others, all six are considered “adjacent”.</li><li>On <a href=\"https://www.aamt.edu.au/var/aamt/storage/images/media/tdt/patterns/p_cm_m2_fig1/277895-1-eng-AU/P_CM_M2_fig1.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\">a straight rectangular grid</a>, the four horizontally- and vertically-adjacent keys are considered fully adjacent, and diagonally-adjacent keys get <strong>half</strong> credit for being adjacent.</li></ul><h1>Letter-pair frequency</h1><p>This is calculated from my personal e-book collection.</p><p>Since “adjacent” is a symmetric operator, there is no point in distinguishing, for example, the TH in “THe” and “THat” and “wiTH” from the HT in “brougHT” and “daugHTer”.  So, I'm combining their stats here.  Letters within a pair are arbitrarily listed in alphabetical order.</p><p>Double letters (e.g., LL or EE), which would have no impact on optimizing the keyboard (since you just hit the same key twice in a row), are excluded from the calculation.</p><p>All figures are rounded to the nearest 1/100 of a percent, and letter pairs whose frequency would round down to zero are excluded from this list.

For around 2 hours, he sat still in fear and silence, wondering if he would survive.</p><p>Then, as he slowly turned his head against the van wall, the ear muffs moved slightly, and he could hear the 2 men in the front seats talking, but he couldn't make out all of the words.</p><p>He heard:</p><p><strong>Man #1</strong>: We (2-3 words garbled) warehouse in 5 minutes. You want (2-3 words garbled) pizza?</p><p><strong>Man #2</strong>: Yeah, but there's a hundred of them in (1 or 2 words garbled). How about that one (1-2 words garbled)?</p><p><strong>Man #1</strong>: What's that phone number on the window? I'll order delivery.</p><p><strong>Man #2</strong>: (3 garbled numbers)-555-2 (3 garbled numbers)(garbled phone conversation)</p><p><strong>Man #1</strong>: (3-4 garbled words) grub by 7:45*</p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong>*After much thought, I changed the time above from 7:30 to 7:45</p><p>Wong knew that they had been traveling with almost no stops or turns; therefore, they must have been on one of the interstate highways. He also figured that they were in a fairly large city because one of the men said there were a hundred pizza places.</p><p>Wong knew that there were 4 possibilities of where he was:</p><blockquote>  <p>Nashville, TN<br>  Knoxville, TN<br>  Birmingham, AL<br>  Atlanta, GA<br></p></blockquote><p>After some thought, he figured out where he was. Wong found it strange<br>that they didn't even think to check his pockets. He used the cell phone in his pocket to secretly text his friends: \"Help. They've taken me to a warehouse in [city name]\", which eventually led to him being rescued.</p><p>How did he know which of the 4 cities he was in?</p><blockquote>  <p>EDIT: There are 2 realizations required to solve this. The simpler one has been figured out already, but the more \"Eureka\" one has not.</p></blockquote>",

You never heard of a city where you can find quantum physicist playing chess with cave painters? A city where blessed cheesemakers and damned tofu-pressers wage their eternal turf war? A city where soap merchants earn more on the packaging than on the soap...?</p><p>What about soapboxes? Wait - you never heard about prophets, either? Yes, prophets. If you know where to look, you'll see it's chock-full of them, each preaching their divinity like there's no tomorrow. And, for most of them, there isn't, since almost none of them has any valid claim to divinity.</p><p>Almost none.</p><p>Which brings me back to the point - as was I saying, four years ago, I was on a trip to El-Kharak, when I met a particular prophet that was a bit different than the rest.</p><p>You see, I was finishing my red herring when I walked past stalls with woolen fluff into a small, circular plaza. In the middle of it, there stood a young man (in fact, incredibly young for a preacher), surrounded by a thin crowd. It looked mostly displeased – but I couldn't tell whether that was a reaction to the prophet's words, or a horrible, rhythmless mess produced by assorted musicians behind him.</p><p>Curiously, the prophet himself seemed to enjoy that cacophony, and even gesticulated along to the noise from time to time.</p><p>I came closer, and I heard:</p><blockquote>  <p>...for I have vast and varied powers! For I shall shower you with boons, for I shall save you from harm, for I shall pave your way to victory!</p>    <p>You might be of a common profession, and you might lack knowledge and skill, and the land might be swarming with ones superior to you. <strong>But believe in me</strong>, and employers shall fight for your attention, and they shall cover you with gold, and they shall praise your name to the skies, and praise your name alone! <em>(Just don't think your peers will do the same.)</em></p>    <p>You might get bald and old, and your good health might sail away on the rivers of booze, and you might forget how it is to see your feet when looking down. <strong>But believe in me</strong>, and you shall have the stamina like you never drank, and you shall have the strength like you never ate, and you shall soar through the air like you never aged! <em>(Just don't think it'll get any better once you actually put the bottle down.)</em></p>    <p>Your prodigal child might live the life free of care, and they might sleep on bags of gold, and they might dream of gag-tying you, and throwing you into a sound-proof room. Behind several locks. Inside a maze. Underground. Beneath a deserted island. In the middle of the ocean. Infested with sharks. Which are carriers for several flesh-eating bacteria. <strong>But believe in me</strong>, and every time you have a need, they shall come to you with tears in their eyes, and they shall crack their back for your spare change, and they shall proclaim, with truth in their heart, their undying love to you. And there will be no obstacle too steep, no sacrifice too high, no adversary too innocent, for them to save you from harm! <em>(Just don't think they'll come to you by themself on weekends.)</em></p>    <p>The sky might be falling on your head, and everyone might tell you there is no time, and you might feel like you need to be in a great hurry. <strong>But believe in me</strong>, and I shall hold the sky, and I shall stall the ruthless hands of clocks, and you shall have all the time in the world! <em>(Just don't think anything good will happen behind your back.)</em></p>    <p>In dangerous times, from lands ever far, invaders might come into your home, murder in their eyes, blood on their hands, with hate in their hearts. <strong>But believe in me</strong>, and believe in me truly, and you shall be surrounded by the brightest of my auras, and you shall channel the full might of my divinity, and it shall cut deep into them!</p>    <p>They might have the courage of a thousand men, and they might have delved into the dark places of the world, and they might have gazed into the unspeakable without a single blink. <strong>But speak a single whisper</strong>, and they shall know fear, and they shall scatter like roaches beneath your feet! </p>    <p>They might have the strength of a thousand lions, and they might have torn flesh like paper, and they might have lifted the mountains without a single drop of sweat on their brow. <strong>But place a single touch</strong>, and they shall know weakness, and they will bend like reeds under your hands!</p>    <p>And they might have cut down a thousand innocents, they might be the very incarnation of ruthlessness, and in their souls they might be not a single spark of humanity left. <strong>But give a single look</strong>, and their hearts will beat again, and they shall finally know peace, and they shall know value of all life!</p>    <p>Believe in me, for I can do all of this, for my name is-</p></blockquote><p>...and before he could finish, out of nowhere came several angry scholars and chased him away.</p><p>The cacophony suddenly stopped, and the crowd started to disperse. I tried to ask bystanders if they knew his name. But most of them didn't know it – some, in fact, were surprised, because they were simply looking at the musicians and hadn't seen the prophet.</p><p>The only person who knew his name, refused to tell me, and advised me not to pursue him. She warned me that in his speech, he had spoken about giving his followers the blessings and giving his enemies the curses, but in fact, he always gave both, and always to those who could worship him. And before I had a chance to respond, she walked away, and so did the crowd.</p><p>And that's the story. I've been thinking about the prophet ever since, dreaming about what I could do with his gifts.</p><p>You're always a great help when somebody's puzzled, so I wanted to ask you:</p><p><strong><em>Can you figure out the prophet's name?</em></strong></p><hr><p>I know that this might be hard, so I'll try to jog my memory and give you details that might have been important in the hintsight. I mean, hindsight.</p><p><strong>#1</strong> Hint about the words:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> While what the prophet said is what the prophet said, I feel that a few select phrases might have a subtle double meaning. Just don't overthink it. Also - the formatting is for your reading convenience only and carries no special meaning.</p></blockquote><p><strong>#2</strong> Hint about the musicians:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> The musician were grouped into two bands.</p></blockquote><p><strong>#3</strong> Hint about the scholars:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> The scholars carried small boxes. They were of no particular colour, but many were white.</p></blockquote><p><strong>#4</strong> Further hint about the musicians:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> Some of the musicians belonged to a three-person band. There were only two of them present, though. When asked about that, they said that the middle one rarely shows up, partly because most critics refuse to recognize him.</p></blockquote><p><strong>#5</strong> Even further hint about the musicians:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> The remaining musicians were members of a single band. They used to work in the textile market, but were forced to change careers. Since they looked as if they could be revolutionaries, I asked them if they were anti-establishment, but they said no, they were the opposite.</p></blockquote><p><strong>#6</strong> An actual hint that's also the last, that also will probably solve the puzzle all by itself:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> The names of the music bands, when combined with their \"music\", actually form a pun on the prophet's name. Because of the nature of the prophet's name, each band of musicians represents something specific and relevant to the prophet's name - but that is totally not obvious unless you know about the pun being there in the first place.</p></blockquote><p><strong>#7</strong> Extra hint:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> To determine the names of the bands, you need to look in the theory of literature for one and in the history of England for another.</p></blockquote><p><strong>#8</strong> Extra-extra hint:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> About that double meaning from <strong>#1</strong>... On your second reading of the prophet's speech, you should be aware that not every ailment is caused by an enormous belly - even when you assume it is.</p></blockquote><p><strong>#9</strong> Extra-extra-extra hint:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> I have it on a good record that many of these scholars are fond of jam. Especially the kind that's made of boars, deers, rabbits and pheasants.</p></blockquote><p><strong>#10</strong> Yet another hint:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> The bigger band's lucky numbers are 1811 and 1816. As for the smaller band, I'll rephrase what I said: the second person was missing.</p></blockquote><hr><p>Not-really-a-hint about an inside joke you probably won't get, but if you get it, the puzzle will solve itself (no, seriously, it's a non-hint if you aren't from that community):</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> Actually, I just remembered, that one person from the crowd told me to go to a place where, err, they play dies, I think? And ask for, uh, that one president? And something about the beard? And he will tell me all about it? Hm. No, that can't be right.</p></blockquote><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I have numbered the hints for convenience.</p>",

During her birthday dinner with her father, the King, they have the following conversation:</p><blockquote><p><strong>King:</strong> Happy Birthday Princess! I'm going to give you $1000 to spend on whatever you want this year!<br /><strong>Princess:</strong> But I don't want money, Daddy! I don't want you to execute the prisoners!<br /><strong>K:</strong> Now now honey, you know I can't do that! Besides, their leader, Robin Hood, has already boasted that he has come up with a 30.68% of survival strategy, though I haven't personally figured out what it is yet...<br /><strong>P (silently, to herself):</strong> Really? I've already figured out that strategy.<br /><strong>P:</strong> Why not? They don't deserve to die!<br /><strong>K:</strong> Okay, I won't just free them all, but I'll give you a chance to save them. I'll let you spend birthday money on helping the prisoners out...</p></blockquote><p>You, dear reader, are the Princess. You have a budget of <strong>$1000</strong>. You do not know any of the prisoners names or the order they might go in, except for Robin Hood. Here is what you may buy:</p><blockquote><h3>Message Phase:</h3><ul><li>\\$500: Send a message to the prisoners. This message can be as long as you want, within reason.</li><li>\\$500: Allow the prisoners to send a message to you. The prisoners know you and <strong>trust you</strong>, and they know you can influence the outcome, but they do not know what you are able to do to influence the game specifically. Messages may be sent in either order, but <strong>must occur before any of the other game actions</strong>. This message can also be as long as they want (within reason).<ul><li><strong>Update:</strong> It is reasonable / by design to assume that they would tell you their numbering scheme for the straightforward solution.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Update:</strong> It is by design that two way communication is \"possible\" but consumes all your money, and therefore almost certainly not worth it.</li></ul><h3>Preparation Phase:</h3><ul><li>\\$0: Receive a complete list of all the Prisoner's names (this is here so that you would have the list NOW, but not during the messaging phase).</li><li>\\$10: After any messages have been sent, you may open one box and read the name. <strong>Update:</strong> You may do this more than once.</li><li>\\$100: You may swap the names in any two boxes.</li><li>\\$100: You may choose that their leader, Robin Hood, go first (otherwise, it is random).</li><li>\\$300: You may name another prisoner that is not Robin Hood to go first (again, otherwise it is random).</li><li>\\$100: Completely randomize the boxes.</li></ul><h3>Game Phase</h3><p>When a Prisoner enters the room, his name will be announced to you before he opens any boxes. You will be able to read the name on the paper when the prisoner does.</p><ul><li>\\$10: During the game, you may allow any prisoner to open one extra box. <strong>Update: You may buy this multiple times (this was originally intended, but I didn't realize it wasn't clear).</strong></li><li>\\$500: After a prisoner has opened a box, you may swap it with any other box to provide a different result. You must do this immediately upon the prisoner reading the name in the box.<ul><li><strong>Update:</strong> I have raised the price of this to a value that doesn't invalidate existing answers \"correctness\" but does increase the worst-case-scenario cost of pursuing that particular strategy, in an attempt to make it worthwhile to possible pursue less expensive strategies.</li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><p>Other facts: You, as the Princess, place infinite value on the prisoner's lives. It is of more value to spend all your money to get even just a marginally higher chance of prisoner survival. You suspect, correctly, that the prisoners would not number themselves in a way that is immediately straightforward so that the game could not be rigged against them by the King, but they are willing to tell YOU that numbering scheme in their private message.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> Yes, you can assume during game play you may take notes / have a perfect memory. You're a perfect logician (as are the prisoners), isn't everyone in these sorts of puzzles?</p><ul><li><strong>Can you get all the prisoners to survive? What is the probability of survival?</strong></li><li><strong>If it is 100%, what is the most amount of money you can save?</strong></li><li><strong>If it is not 100%, what is the most amount of money you can save while still having a maximum survival probability?</strong></li></ul><p><sub>Note: in <a href=\"https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/23279/lets-deal-with-names-in-boxes-safely\">this question</a> the user talks about introducing a friend but these rules are more interesting and complicated.</sub></p>",

The locals were already out selling their stuff. \"Looking for a good fish? I'll show you a good fish!\" Charlotte was not interested. These were small fish operators, and she had something bigger in mind.  </p>    <p>Ever since she had heard of a sighting of the elusive <em>Clupea ruber</em> in the nearby Ruritan river, her mind had been set to seeing this magnificient beast in the wild once in her life. The problem was that they never stay in one place for very long. Fish is money in a market town like this, but she had no interest in selling or even catching it. She just wanted to see it for herself. Finding it was her life for the moment – it was about fish.  </p>    <p>Making it to the docks, Charlotte had already broken a sweat. The sun was coming up. She only had so many hours of sunlight, and had to make the most of it. She had her water bottles and food with her. She had some spare fish still. The day's plan was the same as always. Move slowly up the river, inspect fish after fish, and try not to let anything pass her by unchecked. She was sure she'd know the one she was looking for when she saw it. Any fish now could be it. She would not give up until she had that fish stamp in her travel journal.  </p>    <p>Problem was, she may have shown up too late. Scanning the river, from fish to fish, might no longer bring her any closer to her metre-long, scarlet-sided target.

If she had missed it, there was little chance an opportunity like this would present itself again.  </p>    <p>Upon sunset she returned to the docks empty-handed. She stepped off the boat, sat down, buried her head in her hands and sighed deeply. Maybe she had lost her chance. Maybe it had all been for nothing.

The first parity case that can occur is this one, where an edge is simply flipped upside down:</p><blockquote>  <p><a href=\"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/aMgcU6PIUhw/maxresdefault.jpg\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5dhD4m.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p></blockquote><p>The second one that can occur is this one, where two edges are swapped: </p><blockquote>  <p><a href=\"http://www.speedcubing.com/chris/images/4as3-adjpllparityl.gif\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/mVsj9.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p></blockquote><p>Neither of these are valid positions on a 3x3 Rubik's cube.

You can't believe your father pressured you into this dumb program. You don't need a 'Certified Puzzle-Solver!' certificate to apply to space cadet academy. What a waste of your summer vacation. </p><p>Ugh, the voice again. <em>We're starting you off easy. When you have figured it out, punch in the code in the keypad on the wall behind you</em></p><p>You spin around. \"When did that get there?\" you think. </p><p>On the wall behind you is a metal keypad with only four buttons, labeled '1', '2', '3' and '4'. Right now it displays '0000'. Right next to the keypad is a pedestal inlaid into the wall, with a book sitting on top of it. You walk over to the book and see it is turned to a story set in a Tolkien-esqe fantasy realm. \"A bit outdated, don'tcha think?\" you say out loud, despite there being no one else in the room. \"Fantasy stories went out of style back in 2130.\" Despite your disgust, you take a quick look at the book. You observe that the pages don't turn; it's stuck at this one story. Once you're done reading, you walk over to the wall and stare at the keypad.</p><p><strong><em>What numbers do you punch into the keypad?</em></strong></p><blockquote>  <p>A band of explorers were plodding along a winding dirt road at high noon. Fringe, the human, began ranting.<br>  \"I told you, Desra, to follow the list. I gave you a list with everything on it, <em>everything</em> we needed for this trip, and you forgot the <em>two</em> things that I need to not feel like I'm freaking dying? I needed a hat so I didn't get this horrible sunburn -\"<br>  At that, Wog and Rangor began sniggering. Fringe's visage was a deep red.<br>  \"No!\" stammered Fringe. \"Don't laugh at me!\" But his protests fell on deaf ears. Wog and Rangor were doubled over in laughter at Fringe's plight. </p></blockquote><hr><blockquote>  <p>As nightfall neared, Wog, with all the grace and subtlety that a half-giant can muster proclaimed \"I'm tired. We're camping. Now.\" The wizard was a bit hesitant but the others shrugged and agreed.<br>  While Desra and the others set up camp, Rangor and Fringe went out to collect firewood. The two collected in comfortable silence for a while, before Fringe interjected.<br>  \"Rangor, do you miss Raina? I mean, I'm aware that Desra is your perfect elf wife - \" Rangor nodded at that. \"But do you sometimes just feel that she's the 'one who got away'?\"<br>  Rangor stood with his head tilted, wistfully staring upwards. \"Yes. Fringe, I miss Raina. I also miss Myra, and Lorn. But I believe that they made me a better husband to Desra. Each time I  stew a rabbit, I remember Myra teaching me. When I sing the Tragror'c lullaby, I remember the time I spent with Lorn perfecting it. The elf women who are not with me any longer made me the man that I am today.\"</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote>  <p>Desra awoke with a start. Did she hear Rangor cry out? She looked over to where his sleeping body lay and instead saw a pile of bedding. She shouted, and the others awoke.<br>  \"Did Rangor say he was going for a walk?\" She asked, frantically, as Fringe rubbed sleep out of the corners of his eyes. \"Weren't you supposed to be on watch?\" She glared at the wizard, who looked sheepish.<br>  \"I left the energy wand back at the castle. It only had two charges left and I didn't think I would need it...\" he trailed off.<br>  \"We will find Rangor,\" said Wog, as he walked purposefully into the forest.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote>  <p>When they arrived back to their village, Desra, Fringe and Wog gathered around the large oaken table in the Wizard's home. They looked with deep sadness into one another's eyes. Finally, Desra spoke.<br>  \"This was not meant to be!\" she exclaimed angrily.   \"Aye,\" assented the others. Rangor's absense felt palpable in the dark, humid night.<br>  \"He is more important to us now that he is gone,\" said the Wizard. Everyone nodded. They sat in silence for a few minutes more, before quietly standing up and heading to their homes.  </p></blockquote><hr><p>Clarification: Only text in quote blocks is part of the puzzle, the rest is flavourtext. Your answer should be a four digit number that only contains the digits '1234'. </p><p><strong>Hint</strong> (that's not really a hint, it should have been in the original puzzle to make the puzzle less broad)</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p>After staring at the wall for a few minutes, you walk back over to the book and see that you've missed something. \"Gah, I'm so oblivious sometimes,\" you think.<br> Below the last paragraph that you read is another, short paragraph labeled \"Coda\" <blockquote> Many days would pass for our band of vagabonds. Without Rangor, no man nor woman was of good stamina. All would cry and not a man among our band had motivation to try and find loot. Upon a day forty days past his passing, our group did rally again for a mission. A dragon was slain, and loot was found. Upon forty days again passing, a body was found in a wood; it was Rangor with burns and scars. It was visibly from a dragon. Our band was happy - as by dragon did Rangor pass, and a dragon did pass also. </blockquote></p></blockquote><p><strong>Hint 2</strong></p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> The voice booms from above again. <em>What's taking you so long?

That means <strong>we are nothing special</strong>.</li>  <li><strong>Law of Boundaries:</strong> The <strong>line of symmetry</strong> in each case is <strong>defined by the mirror</strong> itself.</li>  <li><strong>Law of Congruent Copies:</strong> Changing the orientation of a mirror links to another exact replica of that mirror universe - they are all <a href=\"http://ceemrr.com/Geometry1/Transitive/Transitive_print.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">congruent to each  other through transitivity</a></li>  <li><strong>Law of Interaction:</strong> We cannot exchange matter into these universes because for every <strong>one</strong> particle that attempts to cross the threshhold, exactly <strong>one</strong> congruent particle meets it at the barrier.</li>  <li><strong>Law of Weak Reflectional Attraction:</strong> A weak force along the mirror accounts for substances \"stuck\" to each other across the threshhold. This is why mirrors can be dirty: the boundary has a slight pull that makes dirt, etc stay on the plane of the mirror instead of falling as if there was simply air.</li>  <li><strong>Law of Rigidity and Flatness:</strong> Boundaries such as funhouse mirrors or reflections in water serve only as distorted windows; they must be flat and rigid to allow  actual interaction.</li>  <li><strong>Law of Heat Transfer:</strong> The <strong>medium</strong> of the mirror (metal, etc) <strong>moderates heat</strong> transfer, which is why you don't feel immediate warmth when you touch  a mirror with your hand.</li>  <li><strong>Law of Medium Maintenance:</strong> That which would break the mirror surface due to pressure or momentum will do so <strong>before</strong> trying to pass through.

        "Body": "<p>I never really knew my uncle growing up. He seemed nice enough, but I got the sense from the distant, troubled look in his eyes that there was at least some truth to the rumours...</p><p>Years before I was born, his fishing trawler was lost at sea under mysterious circumstances. None of his crew survived, and when pressed, he'd just mutter something about a freak storm. What is known, is that he spent several weeks adrift and when found, he was near death, babbling incoherently about pirates, treasure, and curses.</p><p>Anyway, my uncle passed away a few months ago, and last week, out of the blue a lawyer showed up on my doorstep with a large box that was, for some unexplained reason, left to me in his will. The box's strange contents included piles of musty, leather bound books, old tattered maps, a small brass telescope, a compass that no longer worked... It was interesting, even a little mysterious, but mostly it just seemed like junk. However, as I flipped through an old book documenting the native flora of some isolated pacific island, a small map fell to the ground...</p><hr><p>As you can see below, the map is hand drawn and shows the features of an unnamed island in exquisite detail:</p><p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/zaDz9.png\" alt=\"hand drawn map\"></p><p>More interestingly, however, is the strange riddle scrawled on the back in a delicate, spidery script:</p><blockquote>  <p><em>Start your search from dead man's cave and follow the clues herein.</em><br>  <em>Sharpen a sword and your wits and you're ready to begin.</em>  </p>    <p><em>Paired up, pared down, the truth exposed, lies within lies.</em><br>  <em>Heading onwards north, reeling seas terrorize.</em>  </p>    <p><em>Right is left and left is right, turn and go until,</em><br>  <em>Twins appear to mark an end, though you'll continue still.</em>  </p>    <p><em>Cardinals sitting in their nests, pick them up one by one.</em><br>  <em>Set them free and follow them, then turn to what's undone.</em>  </p>    <p><em>A leap of faith, surrender yourself. But when things come to a head,</em><br>  <em>Take the easy way out, with the blues left behind, go three and don't retread.</em>  </p>    <p><em>Follow the gaze of the crimson saint as he looks to the pre-dawn glow.</em><br>  <em>The distance the crow flies in to pi, hints how far to go.</em>  </p>    <p><em>Two one fives, all lined up, this time point the way.</em><br>  <em>They also indicate how far. Go now or be led astray.</em>  </p>    <p><em>Proceed until, when viewed from on high, the island itself gives a sign.</em><br>  <em>Next steps revealed as the river reflects and the ancient stones align.</em>  </p>    <p><em>Run forth with what you carry. Confusion becomes clear.</em><br>  <em>Now piece together your reward, you'll find it buried here.</em>  </p>    <p><em>Be warned though treasure seeker, should you make but one wrong turn.</em><br>  <em>The pirate's curse, and certain death, is all that you will earn...</em>  </p></blockquote><p>It's not totally clear, but I'm pretty certain the riddle and map indicate some long forgotten pirate's treasure! Unfortunately, I've been unable to decipher any of it, and perhaps subconsciously I don't want to find the answer myself, for fear of the fate that befell my uncle and his crew... Either way, I've decided I'm turning it over to you. Good luck, but beware the pirate's curse...</p><hr><p><strong>Clarifications</strong></p><p>To be 100% clear:</p><ul><li>Everything you need to solve this puzzle, beyond a little general knowledge, is contained in the map and riddle, the rest is just flavor text.</li><li>The last stanza is also just flavor, but the rest contain one or more discrete directions.</li><li>You can assume that you're capable of crossing rivers, climbing mountains, swimming in the ocean, etc. Basically all squares on the map are valid, but you'll never be directed off the map completely.</li></ul><p>Also, if you want to keep your working to yourself initially (this is a race for the treasure after all!), feel free to just post <strong>in the comments</strong>, the coordinates you arrived at at the end of each stanza, with the last being the location of the treasure, along with what the treasure actually is. Eg. \"<em>AB, CD, ..., YZ - Treasure is a pile of gold</em>\". I'll then give a percentage indication of how successful you were. (obviously, when giving an actual answer, you'll need to justify those steps with valid logic though).</p><hr><p><strong>Hints</strong><br><sup><em>(This puzzle is now solved, but I'll leave these here for prosperity, or for late comers who still want to work through the challenge)</em></sup></p><p>General hints:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> <strong>1</strong>: As @Realdeo has observed in the comments, you can't necessarily assume North is up. Maybe there's a way to confirm...<br> <strong>2</strong>: Don't bother looking for a clue that will tell you where dead man's cave is. Just pick a cave and start. It will become apparent as you progress if you made the right choice...<br> <strong>3</strong>: Almost all the stanzas are effectively standalone riddles, so if you get stuck on one you can still work on others. Though you should still be aware that sometimes things rely on you being in a specific location in order to make sense (even then, you will likely be able to \"solve\" and understand the stanza). Of the individual stanzas/riddles, some are wordplay, some are mini puzzles, some use the map and some are fairly direct (though muddied with metaphor).<br> <strong>4</strong>: No clue will ever explicitly tell you to travel diagonally or any other non-orthogonal direction. Though some stanzas will be made up of multiple individual (orthogonal) steps, making the overall movement for the stanza non-orthogonal.<br> <strong>5</strong>: Don't bother trying to decrypt or decode all the letters around the edge. You won't get very far, as more than half are just random fillers. You'll need certain letters at some point, but hopefully when the time comes, you'll know which ones...<br> <strong>6</strong>: It will make your life easier if the first thing you do is to determine where north is. You can do this before even looking at the riddle.<br> <strong>7</strong>: Incorporating clues given on @rand's attempt at finding North: Paying close attention to the blotches around the compass rose is a captital idea! Plus, I'm sure the pirates would have put one on all four sides if they could have, but for some reason only three have anything visible... What could make those blotches, and why would only one side not have any? ...also, perhaps it's worth thinking about what's NOT there.  </p></blockquote><p>Stanza specific hints:  </p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> <strong>Start your search</strong>: This stanza is mostly just a direct statement, so for the moment, there's not much to be gained puzzling over it (see general hint about dead man's cave above).<br> <strong>Paired up</strong>: The first line is the most important here, as it will help to understand the second.<br> <strong>Paired up</strong>: To clarify the hint above, although the first line is key, both lines still need to be used together. If the first is the key, then the second is the lock.<br> <strong>Paired up</strong>: You don't need to look at the map for this one, just read it very carefully, every single word should make sense once you get it.<br> <strong>Paired up</strong>: The solution to this stanza will be a clear, but short, sentence with a form similar to \"head two north\"<br> <strong>Paired up</strong>: People have correctly realised that there is wordplay involved here... However, beyond some slightly awkward grammar, the first line is quite literal in terms of what you need to do.<br> <strong>Right is left</strong>: Where you are on the map matters for this one.<br> <strong>Right is left</strong>: In response to @rps asking if the twins were the <code>II</code> coordinates - there's multiple possible \"twins\" on the map with the correct ones being validated by your movement. If you know which way north is and you've solved stanza 2, <del>you should be able to deduce/validate both dead man's cave & the twins</del>.<br> <strong>Right is left</strong>: I slightly overstated myself in the hint above (apologies, though I doubt it sent anyone too far off track), you won't be able to 100% validate the twins and dead man's cave yet, but you will be able to narrow it down to two possibilities (one of which you'll be able to discount later).<br> <strong>Right is left</strong>: How would a pirate \"mark and end\" (particularly when we're talking about a treasure map)?<br> <strong>Right is left</strong>: Obviously I've made the twins a bit subtle, so when you're looking for them, consider squares as whole units... also, a pirate would need more than one set of twins to mark a spot...<br> <strong>Cardinals</strong>: Make sure you only free the cardinals that are actually in their nests, no others. If you get that far, what's undone should be clear.<br> <strong>A leap of faith</strong>: Metaphor and the map.<br> <strong>A leap of faith</strong>: Where you're standing and which way you're facing matter a lot here. If it makes no sense to you, you're probably standing in the wrong spot.<br> <strong>A leap of faith</strong>: There are multiple individual steps, but the instructions are all fairly direct (mostly just metaphor with some minor play on words, but no \"tricks\" like the \"paired up\" stanza), just make sure those blues are actually left behind when you follow the last step.<br> <strong>Follow the gaze</strong>: Who might the crimson saint be?<br> <strong>Follow the gaze</strong>: You'll need some very basic (high school level?) maths here, but currently you've almost certainly got it wrong...<br> <strong>Follow the gaze</strong>: The distance to go will be an integer value, with no rounding or approximating required.<br> <strong>Two one fives</strong>: \"Two one fives\" are the key here, but there are several other hints in this stanza to push you in the right direction.<br> <strong>Two one fives</strong>: How could \"two one fives\" be interpreted given the pluralisation?<br> <strong>Two one fives</strong>: Although \"two one fives\" is the key clue, the other sentence fragments are still hints. Ask yourself why I would phrase the rest of it the way I have...<br> <strong>Proceed until</strong>: First line is a simple directive, the second points to a mini puzzle of its own.<br> <strong>Run forth</strong>: What are you carrying?<br> <strong>Run forth</strong>: The first line is your last direction clue, the second line is talking about the treasure itself.<br> <strong>Run forth</strong>: \"Confusion becomes clear\" can be applied to the first sentence or the second line equally (and I've been dropping many hints to various people on how to discover what the treasure is).<br> <strong>Be warned</strong>: As stated in the clarifications, you can completely ignore this stanza.  </p></blockquote><hr><p><strong>Fallen heroes</strong></p><p>A memorial to those who were lost to the pirate's curse:</p><ul><li>Realdeo attempted <code>HT TG ES EN ES MU EI HN HS</code>, but those co-ordinates clearly spell out \"THE NEMESIS HUNTS (geh)\", which can't be a good sign...

He's alive and still searching, with a second attempt of <code>UE IE II CU AE...</code>. Going from \"[c]URSE\" to \"CU[rs]E\" is an improvement, but I still have my concerns.</li></ul></li><li>Timur Kuchkarov has made a cautious start of <code>FE FI II...</code>, but with a low percentage correct, the \"FIE\" upon him may grow to something much worse.</li><li>After various attempts, rand al'thor settled on <code>HT DT DO EN EB EU HU RY RI</code>, but I'm worried for his safety given that the pirates seem to be trying to tell him \"R!

Suffice it to say, you're a bit put out by all this nonsense and want to get home in time for dinner.  You ask the guard how to get home and, gesturing toward the doors, he replies:</p><p><em>One of these leads to salvation,</em></p><p><em>the other two lead to damnation.</em></p><p><em>Three questions you will get to try,</em></p><p><em>but be forewarned, on two I'll lie.</em></p><p><em>Don't ask why, for I just will,</em></p><p><em>You'll have to use your wits and skill.</em></p><p>Hmmm...okaaay.  You've certainly had better starts to the day than this.  What three questions can you ask what will guarantee your safe return home.</p><p>Edit:  Forgot to add, they have to be yes/no questions.</p><p>Second edit:  First off, apologies for neglecting this thread.  I've been on a countryside break these past few days and decided to use the time to 'unplug', so to speak.  I've read through the answers and, while NH and Mike Earnest together managed to get the answer I had in mind, pretty much all the answers presented are, IMO, actually <em>better</em> than mine.  It never even occurred to me that this could be solved in only two questions!  Anyway, just for the record, here's the answer I had in mind:</p><p>Question 1: </p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> Will you answer this question with a 'Yes'?  - This forces the guard to answer truthfully.  His next two answers will definitely be lies.</p></blockquote><p>Question 2:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> 2)  Is door 1 safe? - If the guard says no, that means door 1 <em>is</em> safe so choose that one. If he says yes, you know it's dangerous.</p></blockquote><p>Question 3:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> 3)  Is door 2 safe? - If the guard says no, choose it.  If he says yes again, that means both doors 1 and 2 are dangerous and so by elimination door 3 has to be the safe door.</p></blockquote><p>Hope you had fun with this one. I'll try to make the next one a bit tougher :-)</p>",

While the choice of countries is important for the puzzle to have a reasonable solution, any connection nor resemblance to actual people or events is purely coincidental.</em></p><p>Tension between the US and China is rising. You are a senior officer working for the CIA, in charge of protecting secret technology from the hands of Chinese spies. You also appear in public often, making you the target of many hostile groups.</p><p>One day, there appeared a video, showing you conversing and divulging classified information to a Chinese intelligence counterpart. Espionage, if charged, means maximum security prison for life. The problem? That was not you. You believed that the Chinese government hired a body double and faked the video from mainland China to frame you for espionage. You have to prove your innocence before it's too late, because the system will err on the side of guilt unless there exists \"smoking gun\" evidence.</p><p>You scrutinized the video. It started with the title \"CIA senior officer at a secret meeting in Denver, August 2nd 2019.\" The video then cut to a likeness of you, sitting opposite a desk from two other Chinese senior ranking officers. The video seems to be captured by a hidden high quality camera. The faces were blurred in the video, but the voice sounded exactly like yours. The room was white, illuminated by bright fluorescent light. Besides the desk, chairs, and a clock on the wall, the room was bare. Nothing about the furniture could have told you anything about its origin. Your likeness was able to capture you quite well, and copy your very mannerisms and accent. He must have watched a lot of your interviews. He even wore everything that you have, down to the wrist watch. You know that everything talked about in the video is true, but the Chinese could have known it already from previous espionage attempts. The metadata was stripped bare, and no one knows who tipped the video in the first place. You also cannot unblur the face to show that it is actually not you.</p><p>Suddenly, you had an idea. You went back to your computer and used one last forensics trick...Bingo! The Chinese might have tried very hard to hide anything that revealed the video's actual location, but this showed that the video is recorded in China and not in America! Coupled with the fact that you never left America, you have found the smoking gun to prove your innocence!</p><blockquote><p>What is your evidence?</p></blockquote>",

Ernie  was in need of company, so if I wanted to see the show with him, I should turn up at the <em>Palais</em> no later than 8.30 pm that evening.</p><p>I arrived in time to meet Ernie and we entered the auditorium . The lights dimmed and the curtain rose to show Madame Mu, dressed in a scarlet robe and emerald turban, standing center-stage. The show was very entertaining. A search-light would raster across the audience before stopping on someone who would be invited to speak with Madame Mu. She would ask them to introduce themselves and then, by \"communing with the spirit world\", she would reveal various facts about them.</p><p>About halfway into the show, the spot-light landed on Ernie, who rose and walked down to the stage. He introduced himself as an inventor and amateur mathematician, and Madame Mu announced she would attempt something \"a little special\" here and would try to \"channel the great German mathematician, Carl Fredrich Gauss\". The lights dimmed, Madame Mu slumped slightly - seemingly in deep meditation - there was a short pause, then she raised her head again.</p><p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/AKlX5.jpg\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></p><p>\"Good evening Ernest\", said Mu/Gauss in a strong German accent, \"let me entertain you with a little mind reading and lightning calculation\". The following conversation then took place:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Mu/Gauss:</strong> \"If you concatenate the day (1..31), month (1..12), and year of your birth (4 digits),in that order, you will get a number divisible by 7. Correct?\".</p><p><strong>Ernie:</strong> \"That is true - but there is a 1 in 7 chance it would be truefor any random birthday\".</p><p><strong>Mu/Gauss:</strong> \"If you concatenate the year, month, and day of your birth,in that order, you will get a number divisible by 11. Correct?\".</p><p><strong>Ernie:</strong> \"Correct\".</p><p><strong>Mu/Gauss:</strong> \"If you concatenate the month, day, and year of your birth, in that order, you will get a number divisible by 13.Correct?\".</p><p><strong>Ernie:</strong> \"Correct - and only about 1 in 1000 you could getthat right by chance\".</p><p><strong>Mu/Gauss:</strong> \"If you add together, those three numbers you just calculated plus your age in whole years, you will get a prime.\"</p><p><strong>Ernie (after a short pause forcalculation):</strong> \"You're right again - the calculation works as you say!\"</p><p><strong>Mu/Gauss:</strong> \"And by an amazing coincidence, the same five facts are also true for your father - correct?\"</p><p><strong>Ernie (after another pause):</strong>\"Amazing - all true!\"</p><p><strong>Mu/Gauss:</strong> \"Thank you Ernest, please return to your seat and enjoy the rest of the show. But as you go, can you confirm your father iscurrently twice your age in years?\"</p><p><strong>Ernie:</strong> (returning to his seat) \"In whole years, yes, that's true.\"</p></blockquote><p>Later Ernie told me exactly how Mu did her trickery: something to do with internet searches, a hidden radio earpiece, and an accomplice with a \"top model clockwork calculator\", but that isn't the mystery of this story. As you probably know by now, I'm great at recollecting conversations, but hopeless at remembering numbers. I want to send Ernie a card on his next birthday. I can't remember the date but believe there is sufficient information in this story to calculate not only is date of birth. Can you help me?</p><p>PS - As an added note, it may help to know that Ernie's father is alive and well and nothing out of the ordinary in years of age.</p><p><strong>ADDENDUM:</strong> in case it isn't clear, according to what Ernie told me after the show \"those three numbers\" refer to the three numbers divisible by 7, 11, and 13 respectively, not the three numbers that make up the date.</p>",

I'm trying to find a real-world embodiment for this concept.</p><hr /><p>Since there was a lot of misunderstanding I'll try to elaborate.

Police. How may I help you? </p><p><strong>Bakeshop Employee:</strong> Hello sir, I'm an employee in the bakeshop near the police department. I am worried about the house in front of our shop. The owner of this house is one of our best customers, and he asked me to do him a favor. He wanted me to prepare 20 pieces of our specialty bread to be picked up early in the morning. He told me that he would like for his guests to taste our bread. However, it's already the second day since he asked me and I haven't seen him. I am very  worried because he always picks up bread from us early in the morning, and he has promised to pick up his order.</p><p><strong>Police</strong>: okay sir, we will send some officers to the house you are mentioning.  </p><p>As the police visited the house, they tried to knock, but found that the door was open. They proceeded inside the house.  </p><p>They entered the house, and tried to find the owner of the house. They found his dead body, hanging from the high ceiling of a well lit room. There were two glass windows and one of them was broken. It seemed as if something was thrown to break the window. The police that responded to the house immediately called the forensics department and started the investigation. The room was empty; there was no furniture, garbage, or any large items inside the room, only shards of broken glass and the dead body of the owner inside, the police also checked out side the the house where the broken window is and found an empty bottle of beer. broken, might be from the fall. there where also no furnitures that looked liked misplaced inside or outside of the house, the house was pretty clean.</p><p>The police checked the last contacts of the owner and found out that there were two people that the owner invited for a drink in his home, one girl and one guy. They were brougt in for interrogation, and the police asked them questions regarding the scene and what happened when they visited.  </p><p>The girl admitted that they three of them had some drinks, and she also admitted that while she was drunk she happened to have a conversational fight with the owner of the house.  </p><p><strong>Girl</strong>: I said to him, \"No! We can't be together again.\" I don't love him anymore, and I had brought my new boyfriend for him to meet and have a drink. I liked him and wanted to still be friends with him, but he still insisted he loved me and I couldn't handle it. I needed it to stop!</p><p><strong>Boy</strong>: I was there to escort my girlfriend. Although I didn't like what he was doing to my girlfriend, I still tried to understand his feelings. But... it was too much. I had to punch him in the face to protect my girlfriend from him. He is a nuisance and he deserved to die. After the confrontation, me and my girlfriend left the house peacefully and never heard from him again.  </p><p>The police are very puzzled about this bizarre crime and do not know the answer.  </p><p>Now, if you can help the investigators.. <strong>WHO IS THE KILLER?</strong>  </p><p>Bonus Question: <strong>How was the owner Killed?</strong></p>",

        "Body": "<p>So, I was bored and I made a small game for this site! In this game the user who solves the previous puzzle gets to create the next one and they will always be more complex. Website link and string down below!</p><p>How it works:</p><ul><li>You paste in the current puzzle string in the input box and press reset just to be sure. This will setup the game and place \"invisible\" mirrors on the board of which there are 8 types.</li><li>You shoot lasers with a click on one of the small boxes on the side of the board the green color tells you where the laser shot came from and blue tells you where it exited. If there is only a blue box and no green box then it means that the laser entered and exited in the same box.</li><li>You place the mirrors with first clicking on one and then clicking on a square on the board, to delete a mirror click on it again or overwrite it with another</li><li><p>The 8 mirrors are:</p><ul><li>Vertical and horizontal reflection mirrors (worth 1 point). As a example, let's take the horizontal mirror. If the laser comes from above or below it getsreflected back in the opposite direction. If it comes from left or right it passes through the mirror.</li><li>45° degree mirrors (worth 3 points). I think this is pretty self explanatory as to what happens.</li><li>Rotating vertical and horizontal mirrors (worth 5 points). These behave the same way as their standard counterparts with the added ability that when they get hit they turn into their opposite. So if the laser comes from above at a horizontal rotating mirror it gets bounced back up and the mirror now becomes a vertical one, which then again turns into a horizontal one if it gets hit again etc etc. The rotation occurs also if the laser passes through.</li><li>Rotating 45° degree mirrors (worth 7 points). These are the same as the standard 45° mirrors with the rotation ability</li></ul></li><li><p>Your goal in this game is to figure out at which position what mirror is under. You got some things to help you with this:</p><ul><li>The first is the point counter which shows what the total sum of points of all mirrors on the board, so if there is only 8 avaliable pointsand you are sure that there is one rotating 45° mirror somewhere, then that only leaves 1 point left for one basic mirror.</li><li>The second is the number of trys, this is a counter which tells you how many times you send a laser through from any position since innitializing the board</li><li>And the last thing is a counter which tells you how many squares the laser has traveled in the current shot.</li></ul></li><li>The reset button resets the board to its initial state, this doesnt delete the mirrors you placed on the board but just puts the \"invisible\" mirrors back in their starting position</li></ul><p>Some additional things to consider:</p><ul><li>The outer layer of the board can't have mirrors in them</li><li>You need to find out the initial state of the board so if there is only one rotating mirror on the board and you hit it once with the laser the correct solution will still be to place the initial position of the rotating mirror on the board.</li></ul><p>When you get the correct solution to the puzzle a message will inform you of your victory and then you will be able to create the next puzzlewhere you will be able to place a total points of mirror worth $n+2$, where $n$ is the previous puzzle's maximum points. The first puzzle posted by me will have3 maximum points, so the next will have 5, then 7 etc (Scoring is now different in the new version). To create a new puzzle you simply place mirrors on the board. When you place exactly $n+2$ points worth of mirrors you get the next puzzle string. When you are creating a new puzzle you will also be able to see the actual laser traveling, and if the laser travels over a box multiple times the color will get darker.</p><p>You should also probably sort this thread after date to see the latest puzzle. The next valid puzzle in the chain will be earliest one with the correct solution to the previous one. The last thing I want to impose is the correct format of a valid answer.

There is no distinct starting point neither for encrypting, nor for decrypting. i.e. if \"ABCDEFG\" maps on \"TUVWXYZ\", then \"DEFGABCD\" will map onto \"WXYZTUV\" <em>or</em> \"XYZTUVW\" <em>or</em> any other cyclic permutation of the above.

Deciphering will require a reversal of both the sequence of the 26 steps as well as each of the individual 26 steps. The sequence follows the natural 'order' of the 26 classes.</p></blockquote>",

        "Body": "<p><em>Here's the first riddle I invented for Puzzling SE. Hope you'll enjoy solving it.</em></p><p>This story takes place during World War II. A German spy is assigned the task to sneak overnight into a military base near London and steal secret documents of utmost importance.</p><p>The documents are kept inside 30 safes of reinforced unbreakable steel, and each safe is protected by a numeric secret code. Therefore the only way to get the documents is to open each safe with the correct code. If the wrong code is entered, the safe will immediately trigger a siren which will alert all military personnel, so the spy has only one try available.</p><p>German Intelligence was able to provide the spy with the following information: <br>First, it looks like the codes were not chosen at random, but instead follow some unknown pattern. Second, they intercepted half of the safes' codes, which they communicate to the spy:</p><pre><code>Safe   Code#1     2#2     4#3     6 #4     8#5     10#6     12#7     14#8     16#9     18#10    20#11    22#12    24#13    26#14    28#15    30</code></pre><p>The second half of the safes' codes is still unknown. German Intelligence advises the spy to delay the mission until all codes have been discovered; however, the spy believes that the pattern is obvious, as a safe's code appears to be the double of the safe's number.</p><p>That same night, the spy enters unseen the military base, finds the safes, silently opens each one of them with the correct code and steals the documents. Everything goes well from safe #1 to #17.</p><p><strong>However, when the spy enters the code 36 on safe #18, the safe doesn't open; its alarm triggers, and the spy is captured.</strong></p><p><strong>Can you find why? If not, continue reading.</strong></p><p>A few weeks later, the military base has sixty more safes delivered. The codes on these safes are programmed following the same pattern.</p><p>After the end of the war, the commander of the base is asked by the High Command to compile a list of all safes and codes. He produces the following document:</p><pre><code>Safe   Code   Safe   Code   Safe   Code   Safe   Code   Safe   Code   Safe   Code#1     2      #16    32     #31    28     #46   -42     #61    34     #76    46     #2     4      #17    34     #32    30     #47   -40     #62    36     #77    48    #3     6      #18    25     #33    32     #48   -38     #63    38     #78    50#4     8      #19    38     #34    34     #49   -36     #64    40     #79    52   #5     10     #20    40     #35    36     #50    30     #65    42     #80    25    #6     12     #21    42     #36    38     #51    32     #66    44     #81    27    #7     14     #22    44     #37    40     #52    34     #67    46     #82    29#8     16     #23    46     #38    42     #53    36     #68    48     #83    31#9     18     #24    48     #39    44     #54    38     #69    50     #84    33#10    20     #25    50     #40   -54     #55    40     #70    34     #85    35#11    22     #26    52     #41   -52     #56    42     #71    36     #86    37#12    24     #27    54     #42   -50     #57    44     #72    38     #87    39#13    26     #28    56     #43   -48     #58    46     #73    40     #88    41#14    28     #29    58     #44   -46     #59    48     #74    42     #89    43#15    30     #30    26     #45   -44     #60    32     #75    44     #90    38</code></pre><p><strong>Can you find now how the codes were chosen - and hence why the spy failed?</strong></p><p><strong>Hint 1</strong></p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\"><p> <em>There is an unique solution for the riddle.

        "Body": "<p>This is an original riddle I made, heavily inspired by the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_envelopes_problem\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Two Envelope</a> problem.  I have my answer to this problem, but (full disclosure) even I’m not 100% sure I’ve got it right.  I post it half because it seems very interesting to me, and half because I want to see if others agree with my reasoning.  Enjoy.</p><p>--</p><p>Jack is invited to a new game show hosted by his favorite game show host, Monty Hall.  To start, Monty welcomes Jack and shows him the latest in revolutionary 1970’s technology, a slot machine!  But not just any slot machine.  When a “betting” envelope containing cash or a check is put in front of this device and the lever is pulled, it will analyze it and dispense a “reward” envelope.  50% of the time the reward envelope will contain double the value of whatever was in the betting envelope, and the other 50% of the time it will contain only half the value of whatever was in the betting envelope.  Truly a marvel of the ages.</p><p>Monty hands Jack \\$100 in \\$10 dollar bills and asks if he wants to take the gamble and play the machine.  Having studied some basic statistics in preparation of coming here, Jack is ready to win as much money as possible and runs through some math in his head.  He realizes that if he bets $10, half the time he wins \\$20, the other half \\$5.  This gives him an expected value for each game he plays of \\$12.50.</p><p>(\\$20 * 0.5) + (\\$5 * 0.5)  = \\$12.50<br />This machine is practically printing money!</p><p>Jack plays 10 times, winning 5 games and losing 5 games, giving him $125.  Grateful that studying statistics has finally paid off,  he’s about to leave when Monty announces that Jack has won the right to play the bonus game against Kirby, Jack’s hated rival from his high school days!</p><p>A cart containing 20 sealed envelopes is brought out.  Monty explains each envelope contains a check with a value that is a multiple of \\$2.  The prizes are \\$2, \\$4, \\$8, \\$16, and so on doubling each time, up to the most valuable envelope containing \\$1,048,576.  Jack will chose one of these envelopes at random and let the slot machine analyze it.</p><p>The game is played as follows:  Jack will receive whatever is in the original betting envelope, while Kirby will receive the reward envelope.  Each of them will be allowed to open their own envelope and see what is inside, but not tell the other player.  They then have the option to trade for the other person’s envelope.  If both players agree to trade, the envelopes are swapped.  If either of them does not  want to trade, then they both just keep the envelope they started with.</p><p>Jack picks a random envelope from the 20, lets the machine analyze it, then opens it to find \\$512.  He remembers how he won money playing this machine earlier and eagerly asks to swap envelopes with Kirby, since he knows the reward envelope always has a better expected value.</p><p>Meanwhile, Kirby opens the reward envelope and finds \\$256. Kirby reasons that there are only two possibilities, either Jack has \\$128 and the machine doubled it, or Jack has \\$512 and the machine cut it in half.  Under the rules of this game those two scenarios are equally likely to happen.  In other words, it’s a 50/50 shot for which of those two scenarios has occurred.  That means that his expected value for trading is \\$320, which is more than the \\$256 he has.</p><p>(\\$512 * 0.5) + (\\$128 * 0.5) = \\$320</p><p>Kirby accepts the trade, and both men walk away feeling they had gotten the better of the other.</p><p>Did either of them make a mistake?</p>",

        "Body": "<h2>A Story about a lonely All-Knowing Being</h2><blockquote>  <p>All-Knowing Being kidnapped you and placed you inside its home. You  are well fed and have everything you need. The thing is, you can't  leave and you must play a game of your choice with the Being each day  to entertain it for few hours or more.</p>    <p>As you were about to ask it politely, if you can leave at once, it  knew and answered before you even had a chance to speak: \"I see, and I  knew that that day would've come and will come. The day you manage to  beat me at a game, will be your last day here.\" Then it slowly and  sadly returned to its room as the night was falling.</p>    <p>But just before it closed the door, you asked silently: \"Promise?\" - It replied just a moment before closing the doors: \"I would never lie to a friend.\"</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote>  <p>The next morning you wanted to play <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock%E2%80%93paper%E2%80%93scissors\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">rock,  paper,  scissors</a> hoping you can get lucky. But the Being knew every move that  you will make and had beaten you each and every single time, since  it's all-knowing of course.</p>    <p>You had in mind to play a simple tic-tac-toe since you knew you can't  lose at such a simple game. But it would always end in a draw since  the Being knows how to play each such game perfectly. But you were  smart, and decided to challenge it to a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Connect  Four</a> since the first  player can always force a win if it plays perfectly, and you have all  the time in the world to practice.</p>    <p>The second morning, the Being had already sticked a new \"fair game  rule\" on the game board: \"<em>If the game is played in turns, a set of  rounds should be played where each player takes a role of both the  first and the second player. The true winner is the one who can win as  both the first and the second player. This is to ensure that the game  is fair for both players</em>\" <br> And so you won as the first player  yes, but you needed to also win as  the second player and thus your  plan had failed yet again.</p>    <p>Now as the third morning came, you thought that perhaps it should be a game of pure chance. A coin toss! But yet again, for it to be considered a  \"fair\" game, If one tosses a coin, the other calls the heads/tails or  the other way around. When you tossed the coin, it knew the outcome  even before the toss so you were helpless. But if it tossed the coin  it also knew exactly how to \"undetectably\" force a coin to land on a  side it preferred. And no, it didn't conisdered this a \"cheat\" since  even a powerful slow motion camera could not capture and prove its  dirty trick.</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote>  <p>You thought, that there isn't any hope. Since it knows everything, it  can easily find a way to prevent you from winning. Even if you found a  game you can easily win every time, it could know a way to  undetectably and secretly make you play a wrong move and you wouldn't  even realize you were distracted!</p>    <p>And so as one of the many mornings was rising yet again, you were  already accepting your destiny to stay here forever. But you noticed  the Being being sad and worried, and then it said: \"I knew this day  had to come. Of course I did. I had to know. I know everything.\"</p>    <p>And you stood there confused. \"Is this the day I am set free? But how  could it be? I haven't even thought of a specific game to play for  today.\" But suddenly your heart started jumping wildly. \"I KNOW IT.  HOW COULD I HAVE BEEN SO BLIND?\"  </p>    <p>\"Being!\" you shouted.<br>  \"I CHALLENGE YOU TO A GAME OF...\"</p></blockquote><hr><blockquote>  <p><strong>The puzzle question is, to come up with the game that had set you free  by the end of that final day.</strong></p></blockquote><p><br>I have a <strong>specific solution</strong> in mind that is required to solve the puzzle, but if you have your own \"thinking outside of the box\" solution or a clever way to trick the Being, that would be interesting.</p><p><strong>NOTE:</strong> (One of the ways you can \"think outside of the box\") </p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> The game you propose doesn't need to be a real life game already existing somewhere. You can come up with your own game, and as long as the Being considers it \"fair\" (If it's fair when played between 2 random humans, there is no reason it shouldn't be fair).</p></blockquote><hr><h2>Notes</h2><p>NOTE: <a href=\"https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/25966/mithrandir\">Mithrandir</a> had a interesting <a href=\"https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/a/47148/\">possibility</a> for a solution, but in order to \"win\", you can't just win by the rules of the played game. You need to \"beat\" the Being in the game overall. That means if multiple \"wins\" can be achieved, they are merely counted as points. Thus his solution does not quite fit. Also, do not omit the fact that the Being defines \"the fair game\", but also don't misunderstand that fact either. This note is just to make the puzzle more clear.</p><p>NOTE: <a href=\"https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/users/27085/philip-schiff\">Philip Schiff</a> also had an idea, but it does not fit. If your game is a set of games and the goal is to lose most games, winning a game in the set will not be considered a win. Problem here is the <strong>definition of a win</strong>. The true \"win\" is acquired by satisfying the win condition of the overall game. The overall game here is the set of games itself. Same case as the win as the first player in a Connect Four as mentioned in the story. It does not count since the overall game is being defined as a set of the two or more proposed games to make it \"fair\".</p><p>NOTE: A game is not really a game if you are \"not playing it\", thus a \"Pure chance game\" isn't actually a game. You need to have at least some interaction to be considered a playable game. And if there is interaction, being gets a chance to \"cheat\".</p><hr><h2>Hints</h2><p>Since the puzzle itself caused many confusions and misunderstanding, I decided to drop some hints and sleep on it (I actually mentioned this somewhere in the comments I think.):</p><p>$(0)$</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> To beat it you need to use the $2$ things you know about against it.</p></blockquote><p>$(1)$</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> It can't lie to you, since you are its \"friend\".</p></blockquote><p>$(2)$</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> It knows everything, since it is all-knowing.</p></blockquote><hr><h2>Message to Viewers</h2><p>You people had some nice thinking outside of the box solutions so far, and I think I wrongly tried to declare them all \"not fitting\" by putting up all sorts of specific constrains. You can say I was trying to \"force\" you to think of the specific solution that combines the both hints in a single game. I should've stayed more open minded perhaps. Anyway, <em>a comment on the hints:</em></p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> I guess anything that uses the \"knowledge\" and the fact that the being can't cheat by lying, thus can't \"not know something\" can work perfectly fine against it. </p></blockquote><p>The real solution is based on that and could actually even be a really interesting game in real life among $2$ or more players.</p>",

That is to say, there are two parts to a cryptic rebus:</p><ul><li>a <strong>definition</strong> of the answer</li><li>a <strong>subsidiary indicator</strong> of the answer.</li></ul><p>A definition can take the form of a picture which straightforwardly represents the answer, or it can be a synonym of the answer.</p><p>The subsidiary indicator of the answer, on the other hand, will be some kind of rebus word/image play which leads to the answer.</p><p>Here is an example:</p><p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YfHG8.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/YfHG8.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p><p>This clue depicts a pen beside a sill, both above the word <em>draw</em>. The pen and sill are a rebus for PENCIL, which, when taken as a verb, is a synonym of <em>draw</em>. The word <em>draw</em> constitutes the definition of the clue, and the PEN + SILL rebus constitutes the subsidiary indicator.</p><p>This simple example illustrates the structure of a cryptic rebus.</p><p>Just like with purely verbal cryptic clues, however, it will not always be clear what constitutes the definition and what constitutes the subsidiary indicator. The definition of a cryptic rebus can appear anywhere (even misleadingly integrated in or around the subsidiary indicator). Part of the fun of these puzzles is the thrill the solver gets upon discovering where exactly to “split” the clue into its components.</p><p>Also like purely verbal cryptic clues, there is an exception to the rule that all clues consist of a definition and a subsidiary indicator. So-called double (or triple) rebuses comprise multiple rebuses, all of which, when solved, unequivocally signal the answer.</p><p>Lastly, rebuses can utilize any standard cryptic conventions. They can signal containment, reversals, beheadings, anagrams, and homophones. They can also make use of abbreviations.</p><p>Answers should indicate the solution, the definition, and the path to the solution.

        "Body": "<p>You work for a secret organization, and recently the personal data of a terrorist leader has fallen into your hands. This would be great news, except for the fact that all the files are locked with a password. You know that this particular terrorist organization tends to implement a \"three-strike\" rule - after three failed attempts to enter the password, the data corrupts itself and is no longer usable. Luckily, the organization is as forgetful as it is crafty, so they've provided a hint on the password screen. The hint reads:</p><blockquote>  <p>Hint 1: BFplmNVNbACLAMlrBgmDSllV iSTjfJsehRTgsRtM</p></blockquote><p>Being a master codebreaker, you immediately open up QuipQiup and plug in the code. You take the result (NEw loGYGnPULPOliNs oF AllY HaD be Back I D saId O) and enter it as the password - no luck. The password rejects, and another hint is presented.</p><blockquote>  <p>Hint 2: A failed attempt means you've either forgotten the password, or you're trying to hack it. Luckily, I've decided to play fair. Remember that it would be wise to pay close attention to the capitals.</p></blockquote><p>Capitals! Of course! Heading back to QuipQiup, you remove each lowercase letter and solve it once again. You take your new result (NG TO THE CHINKS OF PURPRI) enter is as the password. Again, no luck - the password is rejected. This time, instead of a hint popping up on your screen, a warning message displays.</p><blockquote>  <p><strong>WARNING:</strong> You have one attempt remaining before the data corrupts. Remember, this data is a matter of <strong>life</strong> and <strong>death</strong>! Use your last guess wisely...</p></blockquote><p><em>Can you crack the code and gain access to the data, or will you fail your third guess and render the data useless?</em></p><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> First hint!</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> After some time with no results, you begin to focus on one aspect of the clue. <em>Close attention to the capitals...close attention to the capitals...but what does it mean?</em> Suddenly, something clicks with you. The terrorist leader said he's decided to play fair, but certainly not THAT fair! Either the capitals clue is a red herring, or there's more to the word than initially meets the eye...</p></blockquote><p>And a QoL hint as well!</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> Everything outside the blocked text is just flavor. If you're trying to solve the puzzle, pay no attention to the QuipQiup results. It will only make you more confused.</p></blockquote><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Second hint!</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> You don't have to be a secret agent/genius/master codebreaker to realize that the warning about <strong>life</strong> and <strong>death</strong> is some sort of hint (though it certainly helps). After many, many, many minutes of pondering the hint, however, you just can't figure out how it could possibly be used in tandem with the hint about capitals...</p></blockquote><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Third hint:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> As you stare at the letters, fruitlessly trying to forge them into something useful, your eyes begin to glaze and the letters all start blending together. Uh-oh. You try to blink it off, but to no avail. Perhaps what you need is a DiFfErEnT pOiNt Of ViEw...</p></blockquote><p><strong>EDIT:</strong> Fourth hint:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> 17 days. For 17 days, you've sat in your apartment, mindlessly toiling about in an attempt to discover the password. Your beard is overgrown. Your eyes are sagging. You're tired, hungry, cold, and alone.<br> But your organization needs you. So you press on. <em>\"Another angle...another angle...\"</em> And suddenly, it clicks. The initial text is only the first step in this process, and it doesn't require any software to convert at all. No, this isn't part of any typical cipher...it will, however, require some research. Better get started.</p></blockquote><hr><p><strong>6/11/2015 Update:</strong> Hey, guys!

DON'T LET YOUR SKIN SHOW!</p>    <p>The mountains are dangerous, they live on their own; solitary places, where unwise men atone.</p>    <p>They ascend the mountain, they head towards the peak; their journey it seems, will take a week.</p>    <p>As each hour passes, the danger grows greater; finally the peak, they crawl in the crater.</p>    <p>They enter the caverns, safe so they think; descending to darkness, they must form a link.</p>    <p>The child ignites, his hand of fire; he holds it up high, to see what transpires.</p>    <p>They walk through the caverns, strange symbols of light; like craters on towers, a file with eyes.</p>    <p>Off in the distance, the shimmer of gold; this is the throne room, unguarded, untold.</p>    <p>They enter the throne room, unaware of the danger; out of the darkness, appears an old stranger.</p>    <p>He claims to be Loki, a devious man; he spits out a riddle, just cause he can.</p>    <blockquote>    <p>The answer you'll need, which I cannot give; answer correctly and I'll let you live.</p>        <p>Contained in a place, but not in a play; do take your time, I've got all day.</p>        <p>You may find it easy, just remember, it's me; so many options, no wait, just three.</p>  </blockquote>    <p>They thought for a moment, they collected their heads; if the answer is wrong, they will surely be dead.</p>    <p>They give him the answer, their hands on their swords; ready for battle, they'll fight off his hordes.</p>    <p>A flash of light, and Loki was gone; their answer correct, three letters now known.</p></blockquote><p>I hope you're all enjoying the story and good luck with this one!</p><p><strong>Hint</strong>: Loki has stated that the letter you seek is contained in a place but not in a play.

All you  have to do, is simply type in the name of the baktun eg. \"thirteen\"  and you will be instantly transported! Of course there is more to the  baktun wheel; it has the power to change your life-span. The number of  the letters a, i, o, and u in the word determines how many baktuns you  will live for (e is the only vowel that <strong>does not count towards your  lifespan</strong>). For instance \"four\" has two life-letters (\"o\", and  \"u\"), so you will be transported to the fourth baktun, and you will  live for two baktuns, so untill the very end of the fifth baktun,  having lived through baktuns four and five. You will live clockwise  around the baktun wheel in numerical order, but when you get to baktun 19,  something quite remarkable happens, you are transported all the way  back to the original baktun 1.</p>    <p>Our software has <strong>cross-language</strong> support for all languages that use Latin characters so \"one\", \"un\", \"uno\", \"eine\" and many more are all  accepted. Also alternate forms of the words eg. \"zero\", \"nought\" etc. So you can use phrases (with multiple words), and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">natural numbers</a>, but actual <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_digit\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">numerals</a> are disallowed. However, you must use <strong>denary</strong> numbers only, and you must use an actual phrase that people use to refer to the number be it \"thirteen\", \"bakers dozen\" etc. and you can not use phrases that identify to the number like \"days in a week\" to refer to 7.</p>    <p>Have fun!</p></blockquote><p>That sounds like some pretty amazing technology! Now all I have to do is choose what Baktun to live in... Now I'm very into sci-fi and futuristic things so the later in time the better. In fact, I want to live through as many of the latest possible Baktuns. To make things easier, I will use a points system, the higher the better. The baktun's point score will be the same as the baktun. For instance, if I lived in Baktun 14 for a life-span of 3, the score would be 14+15+16 = 45 points.</p><p>I have opened up the program.</p><p>MagicBaktun.exe:</p><p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9DXR9.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/9DXR9.png\" alt=\"Baktun Program\"></a></p><p>What should I type in for the highest point score I can find?

A plane that would fly to Belgium is going to crash in the middle of the Ocean.</em></p></blockquote><p>The night guard begs his CEO not to go on this business trip.And the CEO believes him. He doesn't go to the airport and cancels his flight.Later that day, on the news, an air-plane crash... It was the plane that flew to Belgium. It crashed in the middle of the ocean.</p><p>The CEO thanks the night guard later and gives him $10.000.<br>The CEO also tells the night guard that he's fired.</p><blockquote>  <p><strong>Question</strong>: Why did the CEO fire the night guard after he saved his life?</p></blockquote><p>Found it in a book: Raadseltjes, thought I'll share it with you :)</p>",

Then, press the <strong>reverse</strong> button. That press will start a complex calculation to determine the exact amount of energy needed to make a similar jump in opposite direction of time. Once that is done, the leap will be initiated.</em></p>    <p><em>After selecting the <strong>random date</strong> option, you notice something strange. Sparks start shooting off the panel, and the time machine shakes heavily. Oh no... the heavy load caused a minor short-circuit. The heavy shaking causes you to hit your head and you pass out...</em></p>    <p><em>When you wake up everything seems normal. At least, as normal as a trip through spacetime can be. You are successfully transported to a different time, and all you have to do now is press <strong>reverse</strong>. You hold your finger over the button but pull it back the last second. In shock you read the travel log screen. You haven't just been sent to another time, you've been sent to <strong>FIFTY</strong> other times!</em></p>    <p><em>In other words, after you passed out, 50 parallel copies of you were created and scattered throughout spacetime. All in identical copies of the time machine.</em> </p>    <p><em>You calculated before that this could happen and realise that pressing <strong>reverse</strong> is dangerous. It will start the return calculation and potentially send you back. However, each copy of the time machine processor is linked, such that if you and your copies press <strong>reverse</strong> more than once, the additional presses interfere with the calculation initiated by the first press. That will send you to some unknown place in spacetime from which you will never be able to return... But not pressing the button doesn't seem like a good option, as then you will stay where you are and never return home either. There is no way of communicating with your other selves.</em></p>    <p><em>When you take another look at the panel you notice that the battery of the time machine is starting to run out. You have to make a decision quick, or you will be too late to start the return cycle.</em></p>    <p><em>You weigh your options. If you don't press, you will know for sure that you will stay in an unknown time and never return home. However, if too many of you press the button, the return cycle is broken, and you will also end up lost in time and space.</em></p>    <p><em>You are desperate, but you know you have to keep your hopes up and rely on your awesome logic skills. Suddenly you realize something that may be helpful. Your other selves have the same logic skill as you. And they know you do too. And they know you know they know you do...</em></p>    <h3>Is there a way you can make you way home? What is the best tactic to maximise your odds? And what chance of survival do you or your copies have?</h3>    <p>To recap:<br>  - 50 copies of you a trapped in a time machine<br>  - All copies, including you, are equal, but independently assess the situation<br>  - There is no way of communicating with your other selves<br>  - There is a return button, but it only works if one person presses it. If multiple do, it sends all of them to a random place in time<br>  - The return button only works for the person(s) that pressed it<br>  - The return button can only be pressed once, otherwise the same will happen as if multiple people do: you overshoot your return trip<br>  - You have perfect logic, and so do your copies<br>  - No telepathy, or anything funky related to the fact that you are copies of yourself. The puzzle would work also for 50 random people with perfect logic.<br>  - You have access to things you had in your pockets while travelling. Including your phone with calculator and other common apps you think are necessary. No internet though!  </p></blockquote><p>Inspired by a puzzle from Vsauce2 (Video includes answer to that question, so spoiler alert! <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkYCWqzBc7M\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkYCWqzBc7M</a> )</p>",

        "Body": "<p>My kids were making this train track of duplo the other day, and this is what they put together. They are still very young, and for them, this is something big. They were really proud that they created this awesome track:</p><p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/oL7Ho.jpg\" rel=\"noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/hj3Xh.png\" alt=\"duplo train track\" /></a><br /><em>(click to enlarge)</em></p><p>I liked it very much. It is built with 2 types of tracks: curved rails and straight rails (the road crossing is basically the same as 1 straight rail). However, as a father, I also don't want broken duplo pieces, so I wanted to make sure the track is not under too much tension. For example: If you want to make a closed loop, you could put 12 curved rails in a circle, and that's perfectly fine. However, with brute force you could put 13 curved rails in a circle, but the track would be under too much tension, and it's probably not good for the duplo pieces.</p><p>I basically have 2 main questions:</p><ol><li><p>Is there any way to quickly see if there is any tension, and why? (I know I could just take one piece out, and put it back in to feel it myself, but I am looking for a more logical way, so I am able to reason it.)</p></li><li><p>Suppose I want to update the track in the picture to have less tension.</p><ul><li>If you have to take away exactly 1 rail piece (straight or curved), which one is the best, and why?</li><li>If you have to add exactly 1 rail piece (straight or curved), what is the optimal place to insert one?</li></ul></li></ol><p>I am sure this could be calculated mathematically, but I prefer a more quick, practical way.</p><p>I found <a href=\"https://www.cailliau.org/Alphabetical/L/Lego/Duplo/Train/Rails/Dimensions/%20Dimensions-en.html\" rel=\"noreferrer\">this very interesting site</a> about duplo rail dimensions, which covers the basics of duplo rails.

        "Body": "<p>You are a mafia leader and because of mysterious recent developments, you had to call the meeting of heads which is happening right now at your's cousin restaurant. The problem is, after the opening toast, Urlich the Unusual who was the key person today fell dead from poison in his glass. It's your turf and to avoid bad name and escalation you have to find who did it.</p><p>There are four immediate suspects:</p><ul><li>Sam the Sommelier, who poured the wine</li><li>Tom the Trickster, who sat to the left of Urlich</li><li>Violetta the Violent, who sat to the right of Urlich</li><li>Willy the Waiter, who served the food to Urlich</li></ul><p>Certainly all of them will try to avoid getting on your bad side, yet, they also want to appear defiant in the eyes of the others. In other words, at least one claim about another person is true and at least one will be false. This is what they say:</p><p>Sam the Sommelier:</p><blockquote>  <p>Tom did not do anything. And neither Miss Violetta. It was that damn waiter, it is his fault.</p></blockquote><p>Tom the Trickster (replying to Sam):</p><blockquote>  <p>Yeah, of course, you're just angry at the kid, it was you, you sneaky, tasteless murderer. Me, Viola, sure are innocent. But Willy, come on, he's 15 or 16 or whatever, he didn't kill anybody!</p></blockquote><p>Violetta the Violent (replying to Tom):</p><blockquote>  <p>\\$#%@ Of course he #@\\$# didn't! Because it's you ^@#\\$@#$, who is true culprit, you %%^@#\\$! Leave the %#% staff alone %#\\$@#\\$, Sam's alright, I'm #\\$% certain he's innocent, you %^@#%!</p></blockquote><p>Willy the Waiter (to the narrator, the mafia leader):</p><blockquote>  <p>I'm sorry sir I didn't react in time, I saw it, I should have told you, it was the lady over there, she put the poison in the glass. Sam is innocent. The gentlemen at the table is innocent too, I'm sorry sir, please don't kill me!</p></blockquote><p>As for yourself, you know that it was not a suicide, and from everyone present only the four suspects could have done it (in particular it could not have been you, the mafia leader). All had reasons not to, but nevertheless, Urlich was murdered. Of course, Sam would whine about Willy, because since the kid was hired, the tips had to be split even more. Naurally, due to his nature, Tom would defend the boy and blame Sam in turn. However, one thing bugged you: you know that Sam and V. detest each other so much that it would be impossible for them complete a single task together, and yet, she still had defended him. This doesn't sound right. What is going on? Who is the culprit?</p><hr><p>Additional clarifications (because comments might be missed):</p><ul><li>the narrator did not do it,</li><li>it is possible that the crime was done by more than one person.</li></ul>",

If this is not in line with PSE guidelines, I apologise in advance.  </p><p>The puzzle begins below, with some flavour text:  </p><blockquote>  <p>Another day in the Puzzling Prison, another weird scenario by the very intelligent, very sadistic, and very bored warden. Having gathered the 100 prisoners (to whom all usual assumptions of intelligence apply) once more, he describes his latest game.  </p>    <p>\"This game is called the Minority Victory Game. There will be a series of voting rounds, and in each round, all voters will take turns to enter a room to cast their vote. At the end of every round, the vote which was cast less is the winning vote, and all prisoners who cast that vote will be exempted from the rest of the game.\"  </p>    <p>\"The game will continue until there are only 1 or 2 voters left, in which case a voting round cannot be valid. My condition to you is this: complete the game within 10 rounds (optimal conditions indicate 7 rounds minimum), or all of you will be executed!\"    </p>    <p>\"You are allowed to convene and discuss your strategy before the first voting round begins, but after that no communication between you will be permitted. LET THE GAMES BEGIN! [insert evil laughter here]\"</p>    <p>Detailed rules of the game: </p>    <ol>  <li><p>A vote is cast by a voter choosing between two random and different objects presented to him/her in the voting room. The same objects are presented to all voters within the same round, but different sets of objects are used between rounds. The main point is that voters cannot agree before to always vote A in a given scenario.</p></li>  <li><p>Voters do not know how many have voted before themselves, with the exception of the very first voter of each round.  </p></li>  <li><p>All voters (except the first) are allowed to know how the voter immediately before themselves voted.  </p></li>  <li><p>At the end of each round, the results will be published to all prisoners (not only all voters).  </p></li>  <li><p>In the event of a tie (e.g. 50 BLACK, 50 WHITE), all voters continue in the next voting round, and the round counts toward their total.  </p></li>  <li><p>The order in which voters are summoned to the room is completely random and changes between every round.  </p></li>  </ol></blockquote><p>Is it possible for the prisoners to prevail yet again, or has the warden gone too far this time and created a truly impossible puzzle? Do any of the rules have to be edited/ removed in order for the puzzle to have a possible and non-trivial solution?  </p><p>EDIT 1: changed rule 1 to increase limitations, but see @Deusovi's excellent answer for a solution with the previous ruleset.</p>",

And what are the historical period and/or events being referenced?</p><p><strong>Edit:</strong> Congratulations to Laconic Druid for posting a correct answer. Here are some notes with additional details to complement his/her solution:</p><p><em>(obviously, these notes contain major spoilers)</em></p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> This riddle is about the story of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_longitude\" rel=\"nofollow\">longitude</a>, a fascinating chapter in the history of sea navigation, science and technology. The historical background is that ships have always needed to know their location (latitude and longitude) to navigate successfully and safely. Measuring latitude is easy by simple reference to celestial bodies, but to measure longitude one needs to also know <em>the time</em> at a specific reference point on Earth, say at the port from which you departed. As silly as it sounds these days, measuring time accurately aboard a ship proved to be a major technological challenge that hindered the goal of measuring longitude, even long after accurate land-based pendulum clocks were developed. This and related navigational difficulties caused major sea disasters such as the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scilly_naval_disaster_of_1707\" rel=\"nofollow\">Scilly naval disaster of 1707</a> (1500 fatalities and 4 ships lost). The problem was so vexing that <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longitude_rewards\" rel=\"nofollow\">large monetary rewards</a> were declared by the British government and the King of Spain to the first person to design a reliable system of measuring longitude. <br><br>The longitude problem was eventually solved in the second half of the 18th century by <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harrison\" rel=\"nofollow\">John Harrison</a>, a clockmaker who (after dedicating much of his life to solving the longitude problem) developed the marine chronometer, a compact but very accurate clock.<br><br> Finally, here is a line-by-line explanation of the riddle: <br><br> \"<em>I could not be measured - there wasn't the time</em>\"<br> Longitude could not be measured, for lack of an accurate time-measuring device. <br><br> \"<em>Yet my knowledge was treasured to help reach friendly climes</em>\"<br> Knowledge of longitude was highly valued (treasured) to help ensure the safe arrival of a ship at its destination. <br><br> \"<em>My ignorance - feared, for it might lead to sinking</em>\"<br> Not being able to tell where you are while at sea (through ignorance of your longitude) was feared, and could lead to disaster. <br><br> \"<em>Now I'm handily found</em>\"<br> These days, if you want to know your longitude, just pull out your smartphone and your GPS/compass/navigation app will tell it to you. Very handy (and makes it easy to forget that we are relying on centuries of scientific and technological innovation, and many billions of dollars worth of infrastructure - the 31 Global Positioning System satellites - to tell us this mundane piece of information that was once considered so valuable and elusive). <br><br> \"<em>it's a matter of lateral thinking</em>\"<br> Aside from the Puzzling-related notion of lateral thinking ostensibly required to solve the riddle, note that longitude represents one's position on the surface of the Earth along the <em>lateral</em> (east-west) axis or direction. Hence this is (I claim) a true lateral thinking riddle.</p></blockquote>",

By way of answer, the air is split by a thunderous crack, as the door slams shut behind you. Spinning, you scramble to reopen it, but instead find only solid stone. Then, staring in disbelief, you watch as a gently glowing inscription etches itself across the wall:</p><blockquote>  <p><em>Gaze upon this thing of wonder,</em><br>  <em>'Neath a sky where stars align.</em><br>  <em>Then with heavens torn asunder,</em><br>  <em>From the shadows comes a sign.</em>  </p>    <p><em>In the runes, the truth is dawning.</em><br>  <em>Can you hear which door will save?</em><br>  <em>Make your choice, but heed this warning:</em><br>  <em>Twelve doors hide an early grave!</em>  </p></blockquote><p>Turning again, your eyes are immediately drawn to an enormous structure, floating weightless in the centre of the cavernous room.

We have a serious issue for tonight's show. Our electrical system has gone haywire and we need your help.</p><p>Phil: Electrical system? I'm not an electrical engineer. I don't know how I could possibly help.</p><p>David: Here's the problem: we managed to fix most of our lighting, but our biggest spotlights still have a serious issue. We have no idea what causes it, but it only started an hour ago, and the electrician said we would have to dismantle a large part of our rigging to fix it, which we don't have time for.</p><p>Phil: I still don't see where I come in...</p><p>David: Here's the problem:</p><blockquote><p>Our 3 main spotlights that we don't use except for the finale are broken. They will work only for 6 seconds each before the fuse blows. The off-switches are broken, and the fastest we can replace the fuse when it blows is 10 seconds, and we need to start from the moment the light goes on, but your assistant is confident that it can always be done that fast. However, the rigging cannot support more than 1 person to replace a fuse at once, so they need to be replaced sequentially.</p><p>Our finale lasts 1 minute, and we need at least one light to be active during that entire period. If that's not possible, we need to know in advance how long we can keep those lights going before all the lights are without fuses. In theory, we can make the finale anywhere between 30 and 60 seconds long.</p></blockquote><p>Phil: So, to summarize:</p><blockquote><p>you only have 6 seconds per light, a fuse takes 10 seconds to replace, and the rigging can only support 1 person to replace fuses at a time. You wonder whether you can let the finale last the full 60 seconds or whether it needs to be shortened.</p></blockquote><p>David: Correct. You're the best lighting expert we have. What's your verdict?</p><p>Can David still do the full finale? Or does he need to shorten it? And if so, how long can the finale last? Obviously, since this is a math problem, you need to \"show your work\".</p><hr /><p>Bonus: Friday the 12th of June, I will hand out a bounty of 50 reputation to the answer with the highest score that continues the dialog and gives the right answer.</p><hr /><h2>Explanation for those that want the story behind this question</h2><p>This core of this question is not about lighting. The original question I thought of was based around a mechanic from the video game World of Warcraft, more precisely the Priest's <a href=\"http://www.wowhead.com/spell=121536/angelic-feather\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Angelic Feather</a> ability:</p><pre><code>Angelic Feather40 yd rangeInstant 10 sec recharge3 ChargesRequires PriestRequires level 30Place a feather at the target location, granting the first ally to walk through it 60% increased movement speed for 6 sec.  Max 3 charges. Only 3 feathers can be placed at one time.</code></pre><p>As you can see, one charge of the feather is equal in functionality to 1 light: once you activate it, it lasts 6 seconds, each charge has a separate 10 second cool-down period (called \"recharge\" here) and there are 3 charges. Charges in World of Warcraft have sequential cool-downs: they don't cool down at the same time, but one after another.</p><p>The reason I translated this to lighting instead of keeping it about the spell is because I assumed that people (especially those that don't play World of Warcraft) would understand the problem easier if I used more known terms like fuses and lighting than recharge, spells and duration.</p>",

        "Body": "<p><a href=\"https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Wordle</a> is a game by Josh Wardle in which you try to guess a 5-letter word in at most six attempts. After each guess, the letters which are not in the word are highlighted in grey, the letters which are in the word, but are in the wrong place are highlighted in yellow, and the letters which are in the correct spot in the word are highlighted green. If a guess contains repeated letters, but there is only one instance of that letter in the word, the second instance of the letter is marked grey.</p><p>I am wondering what perfect Wordle play looks like. One can easily gain access to a day's answer by digging around the source of the webpage, which also allows one to <a href=\"https://bert.org/2021/11/24/the-best-starting-word-in-wordle/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">reduce the difficulty of the game significantly by considerations on the game's dictionary of solutions.</a> Because the the site imposes more limited strategies in this way, I am interested in the strategy a computer would execute for the general Wordle game as defined by the rules listed above. I am considering a strategy to be optimal if it minimizes guesses needed to find the answer on average, without any knowledge of the word beforehand. I am also not necessarily looking for a strategy that is executable by a human, rather I would like a series of steps that can be taken by a theoretical perfect player to minimize guesses.</p><p>For my own play, I have found that (in a certain Scrabble dictionary) the most common letters in 5-letter words are S, E, A, O, and R. I usually guess 'AROSE' as my first guess (although AEROS and SOARE work just as well) which seems to give the best chance of finding multiple yellow and green letters. If 'AROSE' is all grey, this seems to narrow the possible answers by a considerable amount, but if any of the letters are correct it seems that it would not actually that helpful for a perfect player. Therefore, I think that an actual perfect strategy would aim to halve the solution space with every guess, but I don't know if this is correct or how I would prove its correctness. I am also unsure how I would algorithmically determine the best word for executing this strategy at each step.</p><p>There is also the consideration of Hard Mode, a toggle on the website that forces the player to use letters in future guesses which have been confirmed as yellow or green. I imagine that a strategy for Hard Mode would look considerably different from a normal strategy, so I would be interested in answers regarding this as well as the normal mode.</p>",

        "Body": "<p>The following is a probability paradox I've been thinking about.  It involves <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem\">Bayes' rule</a>;  if you're not familiar, a good starting example is a urn that has a 50% chance of containing one black ball and one white ball, and a 50% chance of having two black balls.  If you reach in at random and pull out a black ball, it becomes more likely there were two black balls to begin with.  Specifically, there is now a 1/3 chance of there being black and white balls in the urn, and a 2/3 chance of there being two black balls.</p><h2>The Setup</h2><p>Alice and her husband Bob are kidnapped by an eccentric millionaire that performs probability experiments on people.  Without them seeing the result, a coin is to be flipped.  </p><ul><li>If heads, one of the two of them (at random) will be brought to an office with a big red button that, if pushed, will transfer \\$5000 to their joint bank account.  The other will be left in the holding cell.</li><li>If tails, both them them will be brought to separate offices with big red buttons, each with which removes \\$2000 from their joint bank account.  </li></ul><p>They can discuss strategy ahead of time, but after the experiment starts they will be kept separate from each other.  What should they do?</p><h2>The Plan</h2><p>Alice and Bob reason their only two strategies are to push the button or not.  Not pushing the button is a net zero, and pushing the button yields an expected payoff of $1/2 \\cdot (5000) + 1/2 \\cdot(-4000) = 500$.  Not being particularly risk averse, they decide to go ahead and press the button.</p><h2>The Paradox</h2><p>The experiment starts, and Alice is summoned to an office with a big red button.  She is about to confidently press the button in accordance with their strategy, when she suddenly has second thoughts.  The fact that she has been brought to an office and not left in the holding cell gives her new information.  Using standard Bayes analysis, the probability the coin was heads is now $1/3$, and the probability the coin was tails is $2/3$.  Thus, now the expected value of their strategy is $1/3 \\cdot ( 5000) + 2/3 \\cdot (-4000) = -1000$.  </p><p>Suddenly, not pushing the button seems like a good strategy.  What's going on?  What should Alice do, which analysis was flawed, and what is wrong with the flawed analysis?  If it matters to your answer, assume Bob thinks in a very similar way to Alice, and would likely make the same decision as she would.</p>",

(There is no steganography.) This is only a regular map on an old paper. It has a thick paint layer on the colorful parts, which do not hide any secret, and the white places were most likely scrubbed to make the paper more transparent and give it a more visible distinction.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://puzzling.stackexchange.com/questions/89848/treasure-hunting-with-grandpas-old-map#answer-89989\">Skylar's work</a> showed us the following:</p><blockquote class=\"spoiler\">  <p> Skylar found one of the three important instructions in the text:<br> \"place the eastern trading post to your north\" which makes him think that a rotation takes place somewhere in the puzzle.

He made the following announcement:</p><blockquote><p>From my secret sources, I came to know that the total number of 'sheep' (including the wolves) now present in my kingdom is <strong>100</strong>. Among which <strong>5</strong> are wolves.

Slight breeze made it all the more enjoyable to be outside. Mary and Max were talking and laughing, carelessly gazing at the beautiful dark sky filled with thousands of stars.</p><p>\"What star is the closest to us, Max?\" asked Mary giving him half an apple.</p><p>\"Well, that's easy. The Sun,\" Max responded quickly and possibly a bit pretentiously.</p><p>\"Nope,\" said Mary complacently.</p><p>Max scratched his head and started thinking harder. He laid on the ground and focused all his attention to the sky above him.</p><p>\"Well... You do know that the Moon is <strong>not</strong> a star, right?\" asked Max with a grin on his face.</p><p>\"Of course not,\" answered Mary, as if she had anticipated that question.</p><p>They kept laying in silence, enjoying the beautiful summer sky.</p><p><strong>So, which star was actually closest to them?</strong></p></blockquote><p><strong>Note</strong>: I read this story so long ago, and keep in mind that this version here is paraphrased from my memories which are vague. Even though my English is pretty decent, the same cannot be said for my prosaic style and talent.
